## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Reviving invitee/licensee categories post-Zaluzna
2. Treating activity hazards as outside s 14B(3)
3. Ignoring obvious-risk provisions in breach
4. Assuming causation without inspection evidence

### Rationale
- Common error in misapplying entrant categories despite statutory abolition.
- Mistake in classifying activity hazards under the wrong statutory provision.
- Failure to consider obvious-risk provisions leading to incorrect breach analysis.
- Neglecting the need for evidence in causation assessments.

root((Premises Injury))
  A. Issue
    Premises injury frame: occupiers’ liability, negligence, trespass?
  B. Rule
    s 14B: statutory duty of care; common law continues (s 14B(2))
    s 48: breach test (foreseeable, reasonable precautions)
    ss 53-56: obvious/inherent risk, volenti
  C. Application
    Classify hazard, apply s 14B(3);
    Breach via s 48; consider obvious risk
    Causation: Strong's inspection evidence
  D. Limits/Statutes
    s 14B, s 48, s 51, ss 53-56 WA (Vic)
  E. Authorities
    Zaluzna, Thompson, Hackshaw
    Strong, Deane J (Hackshaw)
