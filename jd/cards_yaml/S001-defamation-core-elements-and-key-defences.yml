front: What are the full core elements, defences and remedies under the Uniform Defamation
  Acts (Vic) including recent additions and statutory constraints?
back: 'Defamation law in Victoria under the Defamation Act 2005 (Vic) includes extended
  elements, defences, remedies and statutory constraints. Apply in sequence and with
  updated statutory references. **Core Elements & Statutory Constraints** 1. **Defamatory
  Matter (common law)**: Lowers reputation in eyes of reasonable people (*Sim v Stretch*
  [1936] 2 All ER 1237 at 1240; *Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton* (2009) 238
  CLR 460 at 473 [24]). 2. **Identification**: Plaintiff must be reasonably identifiable
  (*Trkulja v Google LLC* (2018) 263 CLR 149 at 165 [32]). 3. **Publication**: Must
  be communicated to at least one third party; includes online/search environments
  (see *Google LLC v Defteros* (2022) 96 ALJR 608 at 621 [55]). 4. **Serious Harm
  (s 10A)**: Plaintiff must show serious reputational harm or likely serious harm;
  for corporations, serious financial loss. 5. **Statutory constraints**: s 8 single
  cause of action for multiple imputations; s 9 limits corporate plaintiffs; s 10
  (deceased persons) limits actions; s 10AA single publication rule; s 35 caps non‑economic
  loss; s 37 bars exemplary damages; digital intermediary framework ss 10C–10D. **Defences**
  - Justification (s 25): substantially true. - Contextual Truth (s 26): extra imputations
  not causing further harm. - Honest Opinion (s 31): based on proper material, indicated
  basis. - Qualified Privilege (s 30) and constitutional qualified privilege (Lange).
  - Innocent Dissemination (s 32) (note: distinct from ss 10C–10D frameworks). - Public
  Interest (s 29A): publication concerning an issue of public interest with reasonable
  belief. **Remedies & Procedure** - Damages: non‑economic loss capped (s 35); aggravated
  damages permitted; exemplary damages barred (s 37). - Injunctions: discretionary
  including pre‑publication in rare cases (*ABC v O''Neill* (2006) 227 CLR 57 at 76–77
  [45]). - Concerns Notice and Preconditions: s 12A (concerns notice); s 12B (cannot
  commence proceedings without concerns notice, subject to exceptions). - Offers to
  Make Amends: Part 3 timing (s 14) and effect.'
why_it_matters: 'This topic is exam‑central: many hypotheticals test updated constraints
  (serious harm s 10A; single publication s 10AA; concerns notice ss 12A–12B; public
  interest defence s 29A; digital intermediaries ss 10C–10D). To score H1, apply all
  relevant provisions systematically and integrate recent High Court authority (Defteros
  on publication; Trkulja on identification). Policy tensions include Charter s 15
  (expression) vs reputation; filtering trivial claims via s 10A vs chilling speech.
  Avoid obsolete references (e.g., triviality s 33 — repealed).

tripwires:
- Assuming every hyperlink/excerpt = publication — must check post-Defteros and "editorial
  control" for search engines.
- Forgetting corporate plaintiff restriction (s 9).
- Do not cite s 10 as the source for "defamatory matter" — s 10 concerns deceased
  persons.
- Triviality s 33 repealed — do not plead as a defence; serious harm s 10A is the
  threshold.
- Do not conflate innocent dissemination (s 32) with digital intermediary frameworks
  (ss 10C–10D).
- Misstating that exemplary damages are available.
- Apply concerns notice/pre‑conditions (ss 12A–12B) before commencing.
- Mixing up innocent dissemination with qualified privilege.
