  Mental harm duties (Vic): how do Wrongs Act Pt XI filters apply to rescuers,
    secondary victims, and workplace trauma?
back: |
  Issue.
  When does the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI impose a duty to avoid mental harm in rescuers, secondary victims, or workplace trauma scenarios?
  
  Rule.
  Part XI applies only to negligence (s 72(1)); intentional torts and breach of statutory duty sit outside. “Mental harm” covers both pure and consequential mental harm (s 72).
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Classify harm: pure (no physical injury) or consequential (flowing from physical injury). 2) For pure harm, apply s 72(1) normal-fortitude foreseeability with s 72(2) factors. 3) Check s 73(1)–(2) scene/relationship limits for shock-based claims; confirm derivative bar s 73(3).
  
  Authorities map.
  Filters: Tame/Annetts 211 CLR 317; Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549; Gifford v Strang Patrick (2003) 214 CLR 269. Rescuers: Wicks 241 CLR 60.
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (ss 72–75, s 64); Wrongs Act ss 48, 51 (for breach/causation after duty); Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 79.
  
  Tripwires.
  Treating “normal fortitude” as a plaintiff attribute rather than a foreseeability filter. Reintroducing discredited “sudden shock” control mechanisms apart from the s 72(2) factors.
  
  Conclusion.
  Only plaintiffs who satisfy Pt XI filters and prove a recognised psychiatric illness engage a duty; consequential harm then follows ordinary negligence analysis, and pure mental harm hinges on statutory compliance before breach/cause/damages.
  
why_it_matters: |
  MLS exams often pivot on Pt XI. Fast classification, s 72–75 pinpoints,
    expert evidence, and Wrongs Act s 64 notice show statutory literacy and keep you
    from reviving outlawed “shock” tests. The scaffold balances the floodgates concern
    with compensation for foreseeable psychiatric injury.
