# 0015-causation-scope-interveners.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Treating s 51 as a material-risk shortcut.
2. Confusing factual causation with scope contrary to Wallace.
3. Assuming third-party actions satisfy causation without but-for proof.
4. Neglecting P’s onus and Evidence Act s 140 calibration.

### Rationale
- s 51 must not be misapplied as a shortcut; it requires a but-for link.
- Factual causation and scope must be distinctly analyzed per Wallace's framework.
- Third-party actions do not automatically establish causation; but-for proof is essential.
- P's onus is critical; ignoring it undermines the analysis under the Evidence Act.

  A. Issue
    D's negligence  P's harm  liability with interveners
  B. Rule
    s 51(a): necessary condition (but-for)
    s 51(2): exceptional cases only
    s 52: extend responsibility (justice/policy)
  C. Application
    But-for test; circumstantial inference
    Exclude bare possibility
    Exceptional cases: clear proof required
  D. Limits/Statutes
