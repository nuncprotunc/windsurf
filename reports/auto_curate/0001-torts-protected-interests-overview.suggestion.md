## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Misclassifying consequential loss as pure economic loss.
2. Ignoring Pt VBA thresholds or caps for damages.
3. Neglecting Pt XI and s 74 for mental harm.
4. Confusing possession with ownership in trespass.

### Rationale
- Common error in distinguishing types of loss.
- Critical to apply statutory limits correctly.
- Essential to address mental harm provisions.
- Key distinction in tort law affecting liability.

## Diagram (Mermaid • 5 branches • exactly 12 children • ≤18 total nodes)

```mermaid
mindmap
root((Protected interests → roadmap))
  A. Issue
    Classify: injury / property / pure econ
  B. Rule
    Injury: s 48/51 breach, warnings (Rogers), foreseeability (Chapman)
    Property: trespass (possession), nuisance (unreasonableness)
    Pure economic loss: salient features (Perre/Brookfield)
  C. Application
    Classify interest, apply relevant statutes, confirm possession
    For injury, apply s 48/51, mental harm gates
    For property, characterise interference, select remedies
  D. Limits/Statutes
    s 48 WA (Vic)
    s 51 WA (Vic)
  E. Authorities
    HCA: Rogers, Perre, Brookfield
    Persuasive: Entick (persuasive), Wagon Mound (persuasive)
    HCA: Chapman, Sullivan, Modbury
