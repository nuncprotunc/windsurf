  Interference with goods: classify trespass, conversion, detinue, and state
    the remedy?

  Issue.
  Which interference-with-goods tort applies and what remedy follows? Note: Overflow from front — “valuation dates, return orders, detention damages”.
  
  Rule.
  Trespass to goods protects possession against direct interference and is actionable per se (Hutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131, 132–133), so nominal damages are available even without proof of loss.
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Title to sue: establish actual possession or an immediate right (consider bailors/bailees—jus tertii rarely assists defendants). 2) Characterise the interference: direct trespass (actionable per se), dominion supporting conversion, or demand‑refusal activating detinue.
  
  Authorities map.
  Trespass actionable per se and nominal damages: Hutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131, 132–133. Conversion — inconsistent dominion/refusal: Penfolds 74 CLR 204, 228–230; Bunnings [2011] NSWCA 342, [124].
  
  Statutory hook.
  
  Tripwires.
  
  Conclusion.
  Correct classification governs remedy: trespass protects possession per se; conversion substitutes value at conversion; detinue delivers return or judgment-value with detention damages because the wrong continues until compliance.
  
why_it_matters: |
  MLS exams reward precise sequencing: stand up your possessory title
    first, then choose between trespass (direct interference), conversion (dominion
    inconsistent with immediate right), and detinue (demand/refusal). Each tort drives
    a different remedy—especially the valuation dates and detention damages. Mislabel
    the tort and you misstate the relief, losing marks. Bunnings ensures you remember
    demand/refusal can evidence conversion, while Heavener explains why detinue’s valuation
    waits until judgment. Keep the jus tertii rule and bailment standing in view to
    secure high-band answers.
  
    
mnemonic: "TCD-J → Title → Characterise → Date (conversion vs judgment) → Jus tertii"
rarely helps defendants.: {}
