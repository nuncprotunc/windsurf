front: What are the key elements required to form a valid contract at common law?
back: '**Contract Formation — Essential Elements and Statutory Overlays**

  A valid contract at common law requires four cumulative elements:


  **1. Agreement (Offer and Acceptance)**

  - Offer: Must be clear, certain, and communicated (*Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball
  Co* [1893] 1 QB 256 at 262 (CA), persuasive only).

  - Acceptance: Must be unconditional and communicated (*Entores v Miles Far East
  Corp* [1955] 2 QB 327 at 333 (CA), persuasive only). Instantaneous vs postal rules
  require care.


  **2. Consideration**

  - Sufficient but need not be adequate (*Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd* [1960]
  AC 87 at 114 (HL), persuasive only).

  - Past consideration invalid (*Roscorla v Thomas* (1842) 3 QB 234, persuasive only).

  - For deeds, consideration not required (*Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation*
  (1963) 109 CLR 9 at 26–7 (HCA), Kitto J).


  **3. Intention to Create Legal Relations**

  - Presumed in commercial agreements (*Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA
  Inc* (2002) 209 CLR 95 at 105 [25] (Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ)).

  - Rebuttable in social/domestic agreements (*Balfour v Balfour* [1919] 2 KB 571,
  persuasive only).


  **4. Certainty and Completeness**

  - Terms must be sufficiently certain (*Council of the Upper Hunter County District
  v Australian Chilling & Freezing Co Ltd* (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 436 (Barwick CJ,
  HCA)).

  - Agreements to agree are void, unless machinery exists (*Masters v Cameron* (1954)
  91 CLR 353 at 360 (Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ, HCA)).

  - Conditional agreements tested: *Meehan v Jones* (1982) 149 CLR 571 at 589 (Mason
  J, HCA).


  **Remedies and Statutory Overlays**

  - If formation fails, equitable estoppel may enforce reliance (*Waltons Stores (Interstate)
  Ltd v Maher* (1988) 164 CLR 387 at 404–5 (Mason CJ and Wilson J, HCA)).

  - Australian Consumer Law (*Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)* sch 2) s 18
  prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct; ss 23–24 void unfair terms.

  - *Contracts Review Act 1980 (NSW)* ss 7–9 (persuasive) allows review of unjust
  contracts.

  - *Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic)* s 13(a) provides
  a policy backdrop around privacy and fairness.

  - **Remedies**: Breach gives rise to expectation damages as the primary measure
  (*Robinson v Harman* (1848) 1 Exch 850 at 855, persuasive only), with reliance damages
  available where expectation is uncertain (*McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission*
  (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 411–12 (Dixon and Fullagar JJ, HCA)). Equitable relief (specific
  performance or injunction) may be granted where damages are inadequate, subject
  to discretionary bars (delay, hardship). Restitution for total failure of consideration
  is also available.

why_it_matters: 'This topic is foundational and almost guaranteed in exams. Examiners
  expect candidates to identify whether a "deal" is binding or still in pre-contractual
  negotiation. The triage is: (1) spot whether there is a genuine offer vs mere invitation
  to treat; (2) check if acceptance is valid (postal vs instantaneous methods); (3)
  ensure consideration exists (watch for past consideration traps); (4) apply presumptions
  about intention (commercial vs social); and (5) test certainty using Masters v Cameron
  categories. MLS problems often insert letters of comfort, vague price mechanisms,
  or domestic promises. Statutory overlays sharpen the analysis: ACL s 18 (misleading
  conduct) or unfair terms (ss 23–24) can control overreaching bargains; Contracts
  Review Act 1980 (NSW) offers persuasive support for unconscionability; the Charter
  of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) s 13(a) frames fairness policy.
  Courts balance certainty of contract against fairness; they are reluctant to "rewrite
  bargains" or enforce incomplete agreements (*Meehan v Jones* (1982) 149 CLR 571
  at 589 (Mason J, HCA)), mindful of floodgates concerns. Always conclude with potential
  remedies: damages, specific performance, or reliance estoppel if formation fails.
  High distinction answers weave doctrine with policy and statute, and avoid assuming
  every promise is enforceable.

tripwires:
- Confusing invitation to treat with offer (eg, advertisements).
- Assuming consideration must be adequate.
- Forgetting domestic presumption against intention.
- Overlooking machinery for agreement in Masters v Cameron.
- Ignoring estoppel fallback where formation fails.
- Neglecting statutory overlays (ACL, Contracts Review Act).
- Treating conditional agreements as void without analysing Meehan v Jones.
