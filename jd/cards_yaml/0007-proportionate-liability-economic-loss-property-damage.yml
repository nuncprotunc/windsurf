front: Under Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), when (and how) is proportionate
liability engaged, especially with mixed claims and timing/pleading triggers?: {}
back: 'Issue.

  When does Pt Proportionate Liability Part (Pt Part IVAA (proportionate liability)
  (IVAA)) apportionment apply to Victorian economic loss or property damage, and how
  do mixed claims plus pleading timing affect engagement?

  __HD__0__

  Pt IVAA applies only to apportionable claims for economic loss or property damage
  arising from a failure to take reasonable care (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 24AF).

  Defendants must plead the defence under court rules (no statutory pleading section).

  __HD__1__

  1) Engagement: isolate economic/property loss caused by failure to take reasonable
  care (s 24AF).

  __HD__2__

  Engagement/mixed claims: Hunt & Hunt 247 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth
  Law Reports (CLR)) 613, 638 [27].

  Australian Business Number (ABN) Amro 224 Federal Court Reports (FCR) 1, 58 [114].

  24AN, 24AS).

  Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2 ss 18, 236.

  Assuming apportionment applies automatically without pleading.

  Treating non-apportionable statutory claims as covered just because they are in
  the same proceeding.

  Ignoring s 24AM intentional/fraud exclusions or Australian Consumer Law (Australian
  Consumer Law (ACL))/Corporations carve-outs.

  __HD__4__

  Engage Pt IVAA by isolating the apportionable loss, pleading the defence, managing
  concurrent wrongdoers and statutory carve-outs, and sequencing settlement, contribution
  and contributory negligence deliberately.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps

  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

why_it_matters: "Understanding when proportionate liability kicks in (i.e. the engagement\n\
  \  and mixed‑claim rules) is vital in commercial, negligence, professional liability,\n\
  \  and statutory claim problems. In exams, marks are often lost by assuming Pt IVAA\n\
  \  applies to non‑apportionable causes or by failing to plead apportionment under\
  \ the\n  court rules (there is no Pt IVAA statutory pleading). Strategic decisions\
  \ (settling\n  with one defendant, offers of compromise) depend on knowing s 24AK\
  \ (subsequent actions)\n  and s 24AJ (contribution bar). Policy tensions: protecting\
  \ plaintiffs vs preventing\n  unfair burden on one defendant; risk of \"empty chair\"\
  \ defendants; procedural fairness\n  vs efficiency. Examiners expect clear pinpoints\
  \ (24AE–24AP map), apex authorities\n  an H1 answer from merely competent.\n\n \

tripwires:
- Assuming apportionment applies automatically without pleading.
- Treating non-apportionable statutory claims as covered simply because they are joined.
- Misstating settlement consequences (remember s 24AK governs subsequent actions).
- Ignoring s 24AM intentional/fraud exclusions or ACL/Corporations carve-outs.
- Folding contributory negligence into apportionment instead of dealing with it afterward.
