# 0016-defences-loss-allocation-volenti-obvious-risk-cn.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Treating obvious risk as automatic duty negation without context analysis.
2. Equating awareness with volenti without proving free acceptance.
3. Skipping onus analysis in failure-to-warn disputes.
4. Ignoring intoxication presumptions or recreational waivers.

### Rationale
- Common error in misapplying statutory provisions without context.
- Misunderstanding volenti's requirements leads to incorrect liability assessments.
- Failure to address onus can undermine negligence claims.
- Overlooking statutory provisions can affect liability outcomes.

root((Defences (Vic)))
    A. Issue
      Volenti, obvious/inherent risk, contributory negligence
    B. Rule
      Volenti: proof of acceptance

      Contributory negligence: reduce damages
    C. Application
      Identify defences early
      Prove informed acceptance for volenti
      Classify risks, consider warnings
    D. Limits/Statutes
      s 26 WA (Vic)
      Pt X WA (Vic)
    E. Authorities
