# 0004-causation-s51-factual-vs-scope.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Using s 51 as a shortcut.
2. Collapsing factual causation and scope.
3. Ignoring s 51–(4) on counterfactuals.
4. Assuming third-party crime within scope.

### Rationale
- s 51 must be applied correctly; shortcuts lead to errors.
- Factual causation and scope are distinct stages; conflation is a common mistake.
- s 51–(4) is critical for counterfactuals; ignoring it can mislead analysis.
- Third-party actions must be carefully assessed; assumptions can skew liability.
