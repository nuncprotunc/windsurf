front: What are the elements of trespass to land at common law?
back: 'Issue. Identify the elements of trespass to land and the limited statutory
  overlays that may modify remedies or duties in Victorian problems. Rule. Trespass
  to land is actionable per se: (1) direct interference with land in the plaintiff''s
  possession; (2) voluntary act (no intent to trespass required, but act must be willing);
  (3) absence of lawful justification (consent, licence, statutory authority). Key
  authorities: Kuru v State of NSW [2008] HCA 26; (2008) 236 CLR 1, 19 [43] (direct
  entry); Plenty v Dillon [1991] HCA 5; (1991) 171 CLR 635, 647 (voluntary act despite
  mistake); Halliday v Nevill [1984] HCA 80; (1984) 155 CLR 1, 7-8 (implied licence,
  revocable). Application scaffold. 1) Confirm the plaintiff had possession (actual
  or constructive). 2) Identify a direct physical intrusion or remaining after consent
  revocation (Kuru). 3) Test voluntariness; reject mistake as a defence (Plenty).
  4) Examine justification: implied licence scope (Halliday), statutory authority,
  warrants, or necessity (Southwark LBC v Williams [1971] Ch 734). 5) Quantify remedies:
  nominal or substantial damages, mesne profits, injunctions; reserve exemplary damages
  for contumelious conduct (Graham v K D Morris (1964) 111 CLR 321, 335). 6) Note
  overlays: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IIA for occupier duties, ACL misleading conduct
  affecting entry. Authorities map. Elements: Kuru 236 CLR 1, 19 [43]; Plenty 171
  CLR 635, 647; Halliday 155 CLR 1, 7-8. Necessity/defences: Southwark LBC v Williams
  [1971] Ch 734 (UK nuance on necessity limits). Remedies: Graham v K D Morris 111
  CLR 321, 335. Policy/privacy: Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd v ABC (2001) 208 CLR 199,
  224 [40]. Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IIA (ss 14A-14B); Competition
  and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2 (ACL) ss 18, 20-22. Tripwires. Conflating trespass
  with nuisance (indirect interference). Forgetting it is actionable per se. Treating
  implied licence as irrevocable. Assuming mistake negates liability. Ignoring injunctions/mesne
  profits for continuing trespass. Conclusion. Once possession, direct interference,
  voluntariness, and lack of justification are proven, trespass is made out; address
  defences and tailor remedies, flagging statutory overlays where relevant.

why_it_matters: 'Trespass is an MLS staple because it is actionable per se. Examiners
  expect you to separate possession, direct interference, voluntariness and justification
  quickly, then move to defences and remedies. Referencing Kuru, Plenty and Halliday,
  plus Wrongs Act Pt IIA overlays, demonstrates doctrinal precision and statutory
  literacy.
