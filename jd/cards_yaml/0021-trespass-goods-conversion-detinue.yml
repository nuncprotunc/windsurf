  \  the remedy?\n"
back: 'Issue.

  Which interference-with-goods tort applies and what remedy follows?

  Note: Overflow from front .

  “valuation dates, return orders, detention damages”.

  Rule.

  Trespass to goods protects possession against direct interference and is actionable
  per se (Hutchins v Maughan [1947] Victorian Law Reports (Victorian Law Reports (VLR))
  131, 132-133), so nominal damages are available.

  even without proof of loss.

  Application scaffold.

  1) Title to sue: establish actual possession or an immediate right (consider bailors/bailees.

  jus tertii rarely assists defendants).

  2) Characterise the interference: direct trespass (actionable per se), dominion
  supporting conversion, or demand‑refusal activating detinue.

  Authorities map.

  Trespass actionable per se and nominal damages: Hutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131,
  132-133.

  Conversion .

  inconsistent dominion/refusal: Penfolds 74 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth
  Law Reports (CLR)) 204, 228-230.

  Bunnings [2011] New South Wales Court of Appeal (NSWCA) 342, [124].

  Statutory hook.

  Tripwires.

  Conclusion.

  Correct classification governs remedy: trespass protects possession per se.

  conversion substitutes value at conversion.

  detinue delivers return or judgment-value with detention damages because the wrong
  continues until compliance.

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

why_it_matters: "MLS exams reward precise sequencing: stand up your possessory title\n\
  \  first, then choose between trespass (direct interference), conversion (dominion\n\
  \  inconsistent with immediate right), and detinue (demand/refusal). Each tort drives\n\
  \  a different remedy—especially the valuation dates and detention damages. Mislabel\n\
  \  the tort and you misstate the relief, losing marks. Bunnings ensures you remember\n\
  \  demand/refusal can evidence conversion, while Heavener explains why detinue’s\
  \ valuation\n  waits until judgment. Keep the jus tertii rule and bailment standing\
  \ in view to\n  secure high-band answers.\n\n  \n"
mnemonic: TCD-J → Title → Characterise → Date (conversion vs judgment) → Jus tertii
rarely helps defendants.: {}

tripwires:
- Pleading conversion where the interference was merely negligent loss or misdelivery.
- Omitting a clear demand/refusal before alleging detinue.
- Using the wrong valuation date (detinue ≠ conversion).
- Assuming legal ownership is required when possessory title suffices.
- Arguing jus tertii to defeat a plaintiff with the better possessory right.
