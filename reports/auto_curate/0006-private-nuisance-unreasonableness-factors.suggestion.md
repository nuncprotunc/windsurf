# 0006-private-nuisance-unreasonableness-factors.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Conflating private nuisance with trespass.
2. Assuming public utility is a defence.
3. Treating extraordinary sensitivity as actionable.
4. Seeking blanket injunctions without proportional tailoring.

### Rationale
- Common error in distinguishing between torts.
- Misunderstanding the role of utility in assessments.
- Failing to recognize the standard for sensitivity.
- Neglecting the need for tailored remedies.
