front: "In a Victorian personal injury problem, how do you (i) clear the Part VBA 'significant"

  Issue.
  Has the plaintiff established eligibility for non-economic loss and ancillary heads of damage under the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), and how should aggravated and exemplary damages be characterised.
  and limited?
  Rule.
  Part Victorian statutory damages part (Pt Victorian Bar Association (VBA)) requires a "significant injury" certificate unless an exception applies.
  Sections 28LB-28LK prescribe the process.
  s 28LF defines thresholds (generally >5% Whole person impairment (WPI) for physical injury, extra criteria for psychiatric impairment via s 28LJ).
  Application scaffold.
  Authorities map.
  Statutory hook.
  Tripwires.
  Conclusion.
  Damages depend first on breaching the Pt VBA gateway, then on meticulous application of statutory caps and proper distinction between compensatory (aggravated) and punitive (exemplary) remedies.
  mindful of Gray''s restraint.
  Exam tip: sequence issues -> rules -> application -> conclusion; cite a lead authority and the operative section.
  __HD__0__
  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.
  __HD__1__
  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.
  __HD__2__
  Lead: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR) 562.
  Lead: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562.
  __HD__3__
  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.
  __HD__4__
  
  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps
  
  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss
  
  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.
  __HD__5__
  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS damages questions reward disciplined sequencing. Begin with the
   Pt VBA gate: cite s 28LC(2)(a) to see if intentional or sexual misconduct bypasses
   the certificate, otherwise run the s 28LF/LJ metrics. Only after eligibility do
   you price the claim—loss of earnings cap (s 28F(2)) and the indexed non-economic
   ceiling (s 28G/s 28H). Answers that recite stale dollar figures lose marks; flag
   that caps are indexed annually. Distinguish aggravated (compensatory) from exemplary
   (punitive) using Uren, Lamb and Gray, and note Ibbett to show punitive awards still
   bite against the State. Mention Fontin to avoid conflating provocation with mitigation
   of compensatory damages. This scaffold helps you survive time pressure and signals
   policy awareness around insurance affordability versus claimant vindication.

mnemonic: THRESH→CAP→CHAR→POLICY: Threshold (s 28LC/28LF) → Caps (s 28F; s 28G/H)
 → Characterise (Aggravated vs Exemplary; Gray) → Policy (insurance vs deterrance).
