front: 'Relational pure economic loss (Vic): when does a duty arise for business shutdowns
  or third-party property damage?'
back: 'Issue. Has D assumed a duty to protect P from pure economic loss suffered relationally
  (e.g., business losses when a utility shuts down or third-party property is damaged)?


  Rule. Relational pure economic loss duties are exceptional. Apply the salient-features
  methodology (Perre v Apand (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 192 [4]–[5], 253 [198]; Caltex
  Refineries v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258 at [102]–[103]) as a framework, not a checklist.
  Key features: (i) reasonable foreseeability; (ii) determinate and known plaintiff/class;
  (iii) D''s knowledge/control of risk; (iv) P''s vulnerability (capacity to contract/insure/diversify);
  (v) reliance/assumption of responsibility; (vi) coherence with contract/statute;
  (vii) avoidance of indeterminate liability. Targeted relational loss is recoverable
  where D knew of an identifiable plaintiff (Caltex Oil v Dredge "Willemstad" (1976)
  136 CLR 529 at 556–557). In commercial contexts, vulnerability is decisive: no duty
  if P could bargain for protection (Woolcock Street Investments v CDG [2004] HCA
  16; Brookfield Multiplex v Owners SP 61288 [2014] HCA 36). Coherence constraints
  (Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 at 580–582 [50]–[52]) and statutory overlays (Wrongs
  Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA; ACL (Cth) ss 18, 236) must be considered.


  Application scaffold. 1) Classify the harm: pure (no physical injury) or consequential.
  2) Apply salient features test contextually, avoiding a tick-box approach. 3) For
  pure harm, assess: (a) determinacy of plaintiff/class; (b) D''s knowledge/control;
  (c) P''s vulnerability (contract/insure/diversify options); (d) coherence with contractual/statutory
  schemes. 4) Consider statutory overlays (e.g., Pt IVAA apportionment if ACL s 18
  pleaded). 5) Weigh policy: floodgates v compensating unavoidable loss.


  Authorities map. Core framework: Perre v Apand 198 CLR 180; Caltex Refineries v
  Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258. Commercial vulnerability: Woolcock [2004] HCA 16; Brookfield
  [2014] HCA 36. Statutory coherence: Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59. Procedural:
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA; ACL (Cth) ss 18, 236.


  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA (proportionate liability); ACL (Cth)
  ss 18, 236 (misleading conduct, damages).


  Tripwires. Treating foreseeability as sufficient without analysing salient features.
  Assuming all utility customers form a determinate class. Ignoring vulnerability
  analysis in commercial contexts. Overlooking Pt IVAA apportionment with ACL claims.
  Pleading ACL s 18 without establishing trade/commerce and causation. Ignoring coherence
  constraints from Sullivan v Moody.


  Conclusion. Duty arises only where D knew/ought to have known of a vulnerable, determinate
  plaintiff/class who could not self-protect, and recognition is coherent with contractual/statutory
  allocations. Otherwise, courts resist duty to avoid floodgates and incoherence.

why_it_matters: 'MLS exams test your ability to move beyond foreseeability and apply
  the salient-features framework rigorously. Strong answers distinguish targeted plaintiffs
  from diffuse classes, integrate vulnerability analysis, and address statutory overlays
  (Pt IVAA, ACL). Examiners look for precise application to fact patterns (e.g., utility
  shutdowns, building defects) and explicit policy reasoning.
