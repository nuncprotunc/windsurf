  Issue. In detention fact patterns, which trespass torts arise (battery, assault, false imprisonment) and is the restraint justified by statutory authority or consent?

  Rule. Battery is direct, voluntary contact without lawful justification (Williams v Milotin (1957) 97 CLR 465, 474). Assault requires conduct causing reasonable apprehension of imminent unlawful contact (Zanker v Vartzokas (1988) 34 A Crim R 11, 18). False imprisonment (FI) is intentional total restraint without lawful authority or consent; awareness is unnecessary (Murray v MoD [1988] 1 WLR 692). Once restraint is proved, the onus shifts to the defendant to justify (Ruddock v Taylor (2005) 222 CLR 612, [140]; Myer Stores Ltd v Soo [1991] 2 VR 597, 611). Statutory powers for arrest/entry/force derive from Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) ss 458, 459, 459A, 461, 462A and Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ss 3W, 3ZC, constrained by implied licence limits (Halliday v Nevill (1984) 155 CLR 1, 10–11). Excessive force converts to battery.

  Application scaffold. 1) Identify the trespass type: total restraint (FI), contact (battery), or apprehension (assault). 2) Test statutory power preconditions (reasonable suspicion/grounds, arrestable offence, necessity, proportional force). 3) Check entry authority and implied licence limits; unlawful entry taints subsequent restraint. 4) Assess force used; excessive force triggers battery/aggravated damages. 5) Remedies: nominal, compensatory, aggravated/exemplary damages (Fontin v Katapodis (1962) 108 CLR 177; NSW v Ibbett [2006] HCA 57; (2006) 229 CLR 638); injunctions for ongoing trespass.

  Authorities map. FI/burden: Murray [1988] 1 WLR 692; Ruddock 222 CLR 612, [140]; Soo [1991] 2 VR 597, 611. Entry/licence: Halliday 155 CLR 1, 10–11. Battery: Williams v Milotin 97 CLR 465, 474. Assault: Zanker 34 A Crim R 11, 18. Remedies: Fontin 108 CLR 177; NSW v Ibbett 229 CLR 638, 647 [28].

  Statutory hook. Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) ss 458, 459, 459A, 461, 462A; Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ss 3W, 3ZC; Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) ss 10, 12, 13(a), 21, 38.

  Tripwires. Treating partial obstruction as FI. Requiring hostility for battery. Ignoring the onus shift once restraint is shown. Treating mere suspicion as reasonable grounds. Overlooking implied-licence limits on entry.

  Conclusion. Classify the trespass, demand statutory justification, scrutinise force and entry, then articulate remedies and potential aggravated/exemplary damages when authority is exceeded.

why_it_matters: |
  Shopkeeper/police detention problems are MLS staples. Examiners expect you to classify each trespass, interrogate statutory authority, note onus shifting, and structure remedies (including aggravated/exemplary damages) with precise pinpoints.
