  Protected interests in tort: identify and apply injury, property, and pure
    economic loss?
back: |
  Issue.
  Classify the claimant’s protected interest so correct Victorian framework and statutes anchor the answer before breach or remedy.
  
  Rule.
  Personal injury uses negligence/intentional scaffolds with material-risk warnings (Rogers v Whitaker) and a foreseeability floor (Chapman v Hearse). Property turns on exclusive possession and direct interference (Entick) with remoteness kept to reasonable foreseeability (Wagon Mound (No 1) — persuasive).
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Name the factual interest and flag any overlap or consequential loss. 2) Apply the tailored test: injury — duty/breach plus mental-harm gates; property — possession, directness, nuisance reasonableness, remedies; economic — salient features and coherence.
  
  Authorities map.
  Injury: Rogers; Chapman. Property: Entick; Wagon Mound (No 1). Economic: Perre; Woolcock; Brookfield; Caltex Oil. Coherence: Sullivan v Moody; Modbury.
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 48, 51, 54; Pt VBA (incl s 28G threshold).
  
  Tripwires.
  Avoid collapsing consequential into pure economic loss, skipping Pt VBA thresholds, turning salient features into rigid elements, or ignoring mental-harm filters when reframing injury.
  
  Conclusion.
  Lead with the interest classification, then integrate doctrine, statutes, and coherence so the remedy flows logically.
  
why_it_matters: |
  Under exam pressure, triage by interest controls the entire answer.
    Injury uses negligence/intentional‑tort scaffolds and Pt VBA caps; property turns
    on possession, directness, and remoteness; economic loss demands salient features
    and coherence. Sequencing avoids conflation and earns method marks. Pinpointing
    Wrongs Act s 48/s 51 and leading authorities signals accuracy and statutory literacy.
