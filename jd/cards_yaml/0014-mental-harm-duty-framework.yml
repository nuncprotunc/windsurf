  Issue. Does D owe P a duty to avoid mental harm?

  Rule. Part XI applies only to negligence-type failures to take reasonable care (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 72(1)); intentional torts sit outside the regime. “Mental harm” is impairment of mental condition, divided into “pure mental harm” and “consequential mental harm” (s 72). For pure mental harm, duty does not arise unless a person of normal fortitude might, in the circumstances, suffer a recognised psychiatric illness if reasonable care were not taken (s 72(1)), with the s 72(2) factors (shock, presence, relationship, prior dealings) guiding the analysis. Section 73 narrows shock-based recovery: the plaintiff must witness the victim at the scene or stand in a close relationship, and recovery is barred if the victim themselves could not sue (s 73(1)–(3)). Sections 74–75 confine damages for all mental harm (pure or consequential) to recognised psychiatric illness. The High Court rejects rigid “control mechanisms”: foreseeability is the touchstone (Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 35; (2002) 211 CLR 317 at 379 [185] (Gummow & Kirby JJ)). Secondary victims may recover without direct perception, consistent with Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549 at 558 (Deane J) and Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 33; (2003) 214 CLR 269 at 298 [65]. Textual nuance matters: Wicks v State Rail Authority of NSW [2010] HCA 22; (2010) 241 CLR 60 at 76–77 [44]–[52] treats perceiving victims “being … put in peril” as sufficient for rescuers, whereas King v Philcox [2015] HCA 19; (2015) 255 CLR 304 at 321–323 [35], [47]–[49] enforces South Australia’s stricter “present when the accident occurred” wording. Workplace psychiatric injury turns on foreseeability and system response: Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd [2005] HCA 15; (2005) 222 CLR 44 at 57 [36] downplays duty absent evident warning signs, but Kozarov v Victoria [2022] HCA 12; (2022) 395 ALR 369 at 374–375 [2]–[4], 406 [107] insists that known class-risk environments demand proactive systems and follow-through.

  Application. (1) Classify the harm (pure or consequential). (2) For pure harm, apply s 72(1) normal-fortitude foreseeability with the s 72(2) factors. (3) Check the s 73(1)–(2) scene/relationship limits. (4) Confirm damages eligibility: only recognised psychiatric illness recovers (ss 74–75). (5) For consequential harm, run ordinary negligence duty analysis and apply the ss 74–75 gateway. (6) Integrate authorities: rescuers (Wicks), secondary victims (Jaensch; Gifford; King) and workplace claimants (Koehler; Kozarov). (7) Evidence & procedure: obtain diagnosis from a suitably qualified expert (Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss 79, 135) and consider Wrongs Act s 64 pre-trial notice. (8) Conclude by signposting breach (Wrongs Act s 48), causation (s 51) and any defences.

  Conclusion. Duty to avoid mental harm exists only where the statutory filters are satisfied and a recognised psychiatric illness is foreseeable to a person of normal fortitude (or known vulnerability). Consequential mental harm then tracks ordinary negligence analysis, while pure mental harm rises or falls on compliance with Pt XI.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS exams frequently hinge on Pt XI thresholds. Markers expect rapid classification, statutory pinpoints (s 72(1)–(2); s 73; ss 74–75) and disciplined sequencing before you touch breach. This roadmap prevents the common mistakes of reviving outlawed control mechanisms, misusing Koehler rather than Kozarov in trauma-heavy workplaces, or forgetting the recognised-illness requirement. Procedurally, pointing to Evidence Act s 79 diagnostics and Wrongs Act s 64 notice shows you grasp proof and notice obligations. Under time pressure, the structure lets you jettison claims that miss the statutory filters, focus on viable plaintiffs, and articulate the policy balance—limiting indeterminate liability yet compensating foreseeable psychiatric injury—that underpins Pt XI.
  Policy note: This balances 'floodgates' (guarding against indeterminate liability) against 'access to justice' (compensating foreseeable, diagnosable psychiatric injury).

tripwires:
  - Treating "normal fortitude" as a plaintiff attribute rather than a foreseeability filter (s 72(1)).
  - Requiring "sudden shock" or direct perception as mandatory gateways rather than s 72(2) considerations.
  - Ignoring the s 73(1) scene/relationship limits for shock-based pure mental harm.
  - Extending Koehler's "evident signs" caveat to inherent-risk workplaces contrary to Kozarov.
  - Pleading grief or worry without a recognised psychiatric illness (ss 74–75; Evidence Act s 79).
  - Overlooking Wrongs Act s 64 pre-trial notice for psychiatric injury claims.
