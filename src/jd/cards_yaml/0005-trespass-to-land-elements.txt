  Issue.
  Identify the elements of trespass to land and note limited Victorian statutory overlays.

  Rule.
  - Trespass is actionable per se.
  - Elements: plaintiffâ€™s possession; direct, voluntary physical act causing interference; no lawful justification. The defendant must intend the act (to step/drive/leave an object), not the unlawfulness of trespass. Actionable per se; mistake usually doesnâ€™t negate liability (may affect remedies or where statute confers power).
  - Mistake is not a defence.
  - Direct interference examples: entry; remaining after licence is revoked; projecting objects/particles; placing or leaving chattels.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Prove possession (actual or constructive).
  (2) Pinpoint direct entry, remaining after consent is withdrawn, or causing a physical intrusion.
  (3) Confirm voluntariness.
  (4) Test justifications: implied licence limits, necessity, and any statutory police powers.
  (5) If D pleads statutory authority, check Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) ss 458â€“459 (arrest) and s 462A (force), and Summary Offences Act 1966 (Vic) s 9(1)(d) (wilful trespass)â€”these do not displace civil trespass. (Verify current numbering before an exam.)

  Authorities map.
  - Kuru v State of NSW (2008) 236 CLR 1, 19 [43] â€” Consent withdrawn equals trespass.
  - Halliday v Nevill (1984) 155 CLR 1, 7â€“8 â€” Implied licence narrow, revocable.
  - Plenty v Dillon (1991) 171 CLR 635, 647 â€” Police mistake no defence.
  - Lincoln Hunt Australia Pty Ltd v Willesee (1986) 4 NSWLR 457 â€” Media entry beyond licence.
  - Southwark LBC v Williams [1971] Ch 734 â€” Necessity strictly confined (UK persuasive).

  Tripwires.
  - Treating trespass as ownership protection (it protects possession).
  - Confusing trespass (direct) with nuisance (indirect/unreasonableness).
  - Assuming â€œmistakeâ€ or good faith defeats liability.
  - Forgetting itâ€™s actionable per se (no proof of damage needed).

  Conclusion.
  If possession, direct interference, voluntariness, and no justification are shown, trespass is made out; address defences and tailor remedies (nominal damages, injunctions, compensatory/mesne profits, continuing trespass, aggravated/exemplary in suitable cases).

why_it_matters: |
  Trespass recurs in MLS exams. Markers expect quick separation of possession, directness, voluntariness and justification, then concise treatment of defences and remedies. Using Kuru, Halliday and Plenty, with a State CA and a careful UK nuance, shows doctrinal control.
