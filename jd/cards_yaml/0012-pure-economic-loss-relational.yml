  Relational pure economic loss (Vic): when does a duty arise for business shutdowns
    or third-party property damage?
back: |
  Issue.
  Has D assumed a duty to protect P from pure economic loss suffered relationally (e.g., business losses when a utility shuts down or third-party property is damaged)?
  
  Rule.
  Relational pure economic loss duties are exceptional. Apply the salient-features methodology (Perre v Apand (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 192 [4]–[5], 253 [198]; Caltex Refineries v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258 at [102]–[103]) as a framework, not a checklist.
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Classify the harm: pure (no physical injury) or consequential. 2) Apply salient features test contextually, avoiding a tick-box approach.
  
  Authorities map.
  Core framework: Perre v Apand 198 CLR 180; Caltex Refineries v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258. Commercial vulnerability: Woolcock [2004] HCA 16; Brookfield [2014] HCA 36. Statutory coherence: Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59.
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA (proportionate liability); ACL (Cth) ss 18, 236 (misleading conduct, damages).
  
  Tripwires.
  Treating foreseeability as sufficient without analysing salient features. Assuming all utility customers form a determinate class. Ignoring vulnerability analysis in commercial contexts. Overlooking Pt IVAA apportionment with ACL claims.
  
  Conclusion.
  Duty arises only where D knew/ought to have known of a vulnerable, determinate plaintiff/class who could not self-protect, and recognition is coherent with contractual/statutory allocations.
  
why_it_matters: |
  MLS exams test your ability to move beyond foreseeability and apply
    the salient-features framework rigorously. Strong answers distinguish targeted plaintiffs
    from diffuse classes, integrate vulnerability analysis, and address statutory overlays
    (Pt IVAA, ACL). Examiners look for precise application to fact patterns (e.g., utility
    shutdowns, building defects) and explicit policy reasoning.
