front: In a professional negligence problem, how do you apply Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic)
ss 57–60 to classify the standard of care and assess any peer professional opinion: {}
defence?: {}
back: 'Issue.

  Does the defendant meet the Division 5 professional standard or have a valid s 59
  defence?

  Rule.

  Section 57 defines a "professional" and "professional service".

  anyone holding out a particular skill owes the care reasonably expected of a practitioner
  of that skill at the time (s 58).

  Application scaffold.

  1) Identify the professional and professional service under s 57.

  2) Classify the allegation: warnings (apply Rogers/Wallace.

  s 60 bars s 59) versus diagnosis/treatment/practice.

  Authorities map.

  Duty/warnings: Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth
  Law Reports (CLR)) 479, 490-493.

  Wallace v Kam (2013) 250 CLR 375, [34]-[40].

  Statutory hook.

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 57-60.

  Tripwires.

  Applying s 59 to warnings/information (barred by s 60).

  Treating expert evidence as sufficient without proving national, time‑specific acceptance.

  Assuming unanimity or local custom is required (s 59(3) allows multiple opinions).

  Conclusion.

  Exam tip: sequence issues -> rules -> application -> conclusion; cite a lead authority
  and the operative section.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  Lead: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562.

  __HD__3__

  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.

  __HD__4__

  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps

  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

  __HD__5__

  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: "MLS problems demand disciplined sequencing: define the professional\n\
  \  field (s 57), separate warnings (s 60) from practice (s 59), and make the defendant\n\
  \  prove each statutory element, including national scope and timing. High‑band\
  \ answers\n  show the court’s supervisory role (Naxakis), deploy Tanah Merah to\
  \ test reasonableness,\n  and integrate Rogers/Wallace for warnings. Scripts that\
  \ treat expert evidence or\n  local custom as dispositive, forget the burden, or\
  \ ignore s 59(3)’s allowance for\n  competing opinions lose marks.\n\n  \n"
mnemonic: "PRO-WIDE-TIME: PROfessional? (s 57) → Warnings out (s 60) → Identify Defence\n\
  \  (s 59) with WIDely accepted In Australia, significant practitioners, During the\n\
  \  relevant TIME, and court review.\n"

tripwires:
- Applying s 59 to warnings or risk information (barred by s 60).
- Treating expert evidence as sufficient without proving national, time-specific acceptance.
- Assuming unanimity or local custom is required—s 59 allows multiple widely accepted
  opinions (s 59(3)).
