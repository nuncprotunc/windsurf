# 0008-trespass-person-detention-analysis.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Treating partial obstruction as false imprisonment.
2. Requiring hostility for battery.
3. Ignoring onus shift after restraint is shown.
4. Equating suspicion with reasonable grounds.

### Rationale
- Partial obstruction does not meet false imprisonment criteria.
- Battery does not require a hostility element.
- Onus shifts to defendant once restraint is established.
- Suspicion alone is insufficient for lawful detention.
