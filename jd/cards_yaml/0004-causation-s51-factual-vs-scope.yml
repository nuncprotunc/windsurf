front: In an exam scenario, how would you identify, classify, and apply the three
  protected interests in tort law (personal injury, property, pure economic loss),
  linking each to leading authorities, statutory overlays, and available defences/remedies
  under Victorian and Commonwealth law?
back: 'Tort law protects three principal interests, each framed by common law, statutory
  overlays, and policy constraints.


  **Personal Injury / Physical Harm**

  Rooted in *Donoghue v Stevenson* [1932] AC 562 (HL) and refined in *Rogers v Whitaker*
  (1992) 175 CLR 479 at 483–4 (duty to warn of material risk). The *Wrongs Act 1958*
  (Vic) governs duty (s 48), causation (s 51: factual causation under s 51(1)(a);
  scope of liability under s 51(1)(b)), contributory negligence (s 26), and damages
  thresholds (Pt VBA, including s 28LE significant injury test). Mental harm is constrained
  by *Sullivan v Moody* [2001] HCA 59, (2001) 207 CLR 562 at 573 [42], and by *Wrongs
  Act* Pt XI (ss 72–75). Defences include contributory negligence (s 26), voluntary
  assumption of risk (s 54), and proportionate liability.


  **Property Damage / Interference**

  Anchored in the principle of exclusive possession in *Entick v Carrington* (1765)
  19 St Tr 1029. Australian refinements include *Campbell v Paddington Borough Council*
  [1911] 1 KB 869 (interference with easements). Trespass to land and nuisance operate
  alongside *Wrongs Act* s 48 (general negligence overlay). Remedies include damages
  for loss, injunctions for ongoing nuisance, and defences such as statutory authority.


  **Pure Economic Loss**

  Governed by salient features analysis in *Perre v Apand Pty Ltd* [1999] HCA 36,
  (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 197–8 [12] (McHugh J). Further clarified in *Woolcock Street
  Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd* [2004] HCA 16, (2004) 216 CLR 515 at [23] (Gleeson
  CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) and *Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge
  ''Willemstad''* (1976) 136 CLR 529 at 556 (Stephen J). Relational loss remains restricted.
  Statutory overlay includes the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth) Sch 2 (Australian
  Consumer Law) ss 18, 236 (misleading conduct and damages).


  **Conclusion**: Classification of the protected interest directs duty/breach analysis,
  remedies, and defences. Statutes narrow recovery via thresholds, proportionate liability
  (*Wrongs Act* Pt IVAA), and damages caps (Pt VBA).

  '
why_it_matters: 'In MLS exams, correct classification of the protected interest is
  a first-order triage step:

  (i) Identify the interest (injury, property, economic).

  (ii) Apply the relevant common law framework and statutory overlay.

  (iii) Deploy leading cases with pinpoints to demonstrate doctrinal accuracy.

  (iv) Integrate available defences/remedies (eg, contributory negligence, statutory
  damages caps).


  This sequencing prevents conflation of duty, breach, causation, and remedies—an
  error examiners routinely penalise.


  Policy tensions must also be surfaced: indeterminate liability for pure economic
  loss, freedom of action vs protection of vulnerable interests, and statutory reform
  aimed at limiting damages (*Wrongs Act* Pt VBA, including significant injury test
  in s 28LE). Chilling effects on innovation and resource allocation concerns in negligence
  are frequently raised by courts when calibrating duty.


  High-performing answers show both doctrinal fidelity and policy awareness: citing
  *Perre v Apand* and *Woolcock Street* for salient features, *Rogers v Whitaker*
  for risk disclosure, *Wrongs Act* Pt XI for mental harm, and the ACL for statutory
  remedies.


  This card therefore equips you with a reliable IRAC roadmap: classify → authority
  → statutory overlay → defences/remedies → policy tension.

tripwires:
- Conflating duty existence with scope/remoteness
- Ignoring Wrongs Act statutory thresholds (Pt VBA, s 28LE significant injury)
- Overlooking Wrongs Act Pt XI limits on recovery for mental harm
- Assuming all economic loss recoverable; missing salient features
- Forgetting contributory negligence under Wrongs Act s 26
- Citing only headline cases; failing to use Australian refinements (Woolcock Street,
  Caltex
- Omitting statutory authority defence in nuisance/trespass
