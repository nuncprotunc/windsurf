# 0019-professional-negligence-peer-opinion.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Applying s 59 to warnings (barred by s 60)
2. Assuming expert evidence suffices without proving national acceptance
3. Conflating consequential with pure economic loss
4. Ignoring s 59(3) allows multiple opinions

### Rationale
- Common error in misapplying statutory provisions regarding warnings.
- Mistake in treating expert evidence as definitive without necessary proof.
- Frequent confusion between types of economic loss leading to incorrect analysis.
- Overlooked allowance for competing opinions under s 59(3).
