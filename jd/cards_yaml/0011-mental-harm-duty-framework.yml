front: "Mental harm duties (Vic): how do Wrongs Act Pt XI filters apply to rescuers,\n\
  \  secondary victims, and workplace trauma?\n"
back: 'Issue.

  When does the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt Part XI (XI) impose a duty to avoid mental
  harm in rescuers, secondary victims, or workplace trauma scenarios?

  __HD__0__

  Part XI applies only to negligence (s 72(1)).

  intentional torts and breach of statutory duty sit outside.

  “Mental harm” covers both pure and consequential mental harm (s 72).

  __HD__1__

  1) Classify harm: pure (no physical injury) or consequential (flowing from physical
  injury).

  2) For pure harm, apply s 72(1) normal-fortitude foreseeability with s 72(2) factors.

  3) Check s 73(1)-(2) scene/relationship limits for shock-based claims.

  confirm derivative bar s 73(3).

  __HD__2__

  Filters: Tame/Annetts 211 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR))
  317.

  Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549.

  Gifford v Strang Patrick (2003) 214 CLR 269.

  Rescuers: Wicks 241 CLR 60.

  __HD__3__

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (ss 72-75, s 64).

  Wrongs Act ss 48, 51 (for breach/causation after duty).

  Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 79.

  __HD__4__

  Treating “normal fortitude” as a plaintiff attribute rather than a foreseeability
  filter.

  Reintroducing discredited “sudden shock” control mechanisms apart from the s 72(2)
  factors.

  __HD__5__

  Only plaintiffs who satisfy Pt XI filters and prove a recognised psychiatric illness
  engage a duty.

  consequential harm then follows ordinary negligence analysis, and pure mental harm
  hinges on statutory compliance before breach/cause/damages.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  Lead: Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549, 558 (Deane J).

  __HD__3__

  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.

  __HD__4__

  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps

  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

why_it_matters: "MLS exams often pivot on Pt XI. Fast classification, s 72–75 pinpoints,\n\
  \  expert evidence, and Wrongs Act s 64 notice show statutory literacy and keep\
  \ you\n  from reviving outlawed “shock” tests. The scaffold balances the floodgates\
  \ concern\n  with compensation for foreseeable psychiatric injury.\n\n  \n"

tripwires:
- Treating normal fortitude as a plaintiff attribute instead of a foreseeability test.
- Requiring sudden shock or direct perception beyond s 72(2).
- Skipping s 73(1)–(2) scene/relationship limits.
- Extending Koehler to class-risk workplaces despite Kozarov.
- Claiming damages without a recognised psychiatric illness or expert diagnosis.
