## Stage 2 — Upgraded YAML Card

```yaml
front: "Victorian premises injury: when do you frame the claim as occupiers’ liability under Pt IIA of the Wrongs Act vs ordinary negligence or trespass, and how do you run the integrated duty–breach–causation analysis (including trespassers)?"
back: |
  Issue. What legal frame governs injury on premises in Victoria: occupiers’ liability (Pt IIA), ordinary negligence, or trespass?

  Rule. Part IIA replaces pre-1983 entrant categories: an occupier must take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances to see entrants are not injured by the state of the premises or by things done or omitted in relation to that state (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 14B(3)); common-law rules otherwise continue (s 14B(2)). The High Court confirms occupiers’ duty is assessed using ordinary negligence principles (Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7; (1987) 162 CLR 479, 488). Duties extend to delivery contractors and other entrants affected by activity-related hazards (Thompson v Woolworths (Q’land) Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 19; (2005) 221 CLR 234, [23]-[27]). Trespassers may still be owed a duty where harm is reasonably foreseeable (Hackshaw v Shaw [1984] HCA 84; (1984) 155 CLR 614, 654 (Deane J)).

  Application. 1) Classify the harm source: state of premises or things done/omitted about that state → apply s 14B(3) duty, then run breach under s 48 (foreseeability, not-insignificant risk, reasonable precautions) with obvious-risk adjustments (ss 53–56). 2) Causation: use s 51 (factual/scope); probabilistic inference can establish factual causation in slip cases lacking inspections (Strong v Woolworths [2012] HCA 5, [32]-[34]; 246 CLR 182). 3) If injury stems from intentional physical contact by occupier’s agents, analyse trespass to the person (and vicarious liability) rather than premises condition; trespass to land may supplement remedies for deliberate exclusion breaches.

  Conclusion. In Victoria, occupiers’ liability is integrated with ordinary negligence: use Pt IIA for the duty source, Pt X for breach/causation, and reserve trespass frames for intentional or direct interferences.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems mix hazards, entrants, and trespasser facts. High-band answers: (i) identify Pt IIA as the duty source while keeping negligence calculus from Pt X, (ii) avoid reviving invitee/licensee categories post-Zaluzna, (iii) show how Thompson extends duties to activity hazards, (iv) rely on Strong to prove causation, and (v) pivot to trespass where force, not premises, causes the injury. This sequencing respects statutory integration and saves marks.
mnemonic: "SITE → State of premises (s 14B), Integrate with negligence (ss 48/51/53–56), Trespasser duty (Hackshaw), Evidence of causation (Strong)."

  - Treating activity-related hazards as outside s 14B(3).
  - Ignoring obvious-risk provisions when assessing breach.
  - Assuming causation without addressing inspection evidence (Strong inference).
  - Denying any duty to trespassers contrary to Hackshaw.
  - Framing intentional assaults as premises defects instead of trespass/vicarious liability.

- Statutory references include full Part IIA span plus Pt X overlays for breach, causation, and obvious risk.
- No outstanding verification gaps identified at this stage.
