## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Treating foreseeability alone as breach without proving 'not insignificant' (s 48(1)).
2. Framing the risk with hindsight rather than ex ante (s 49 guardrail).
3. Reducing s 48(2) to a checklist instead of a balancing exercise.
4. Over-relying on 'obvious risk' where D's operations created the hazard.

### Rationale
- Common error to assume foreseeability alone suffices for breach.
- Students often misapply hindsight in risk framing, violating s 49.
- Checklist approach neglects the necessary balancing required by s 48(2).
- Failing to separate breach from causation leads to incorrect conclusions.

```mermaid
mindmap
root((Breach: Shirt calculus (Vic)))
  A. Issue
    Specific risk framed ex ante
  B. Rule
    s 48(1): foreseeable & not-insignificant
    Balance (a)–(d) — Shirt
    No hindsight (s 49)
  C. Application
    Weigh probability • seriousness • burden/cost • social utility
    Specify reasonable precautions
    Keep causation separate (s 51)
  D. Statute
    Wrongs Act ss 48–49
    s 51 (separate step)
  E. Authorities
    Wyong v Shirt
    Dederer / Vairy
    Chapman v Hearse
```
