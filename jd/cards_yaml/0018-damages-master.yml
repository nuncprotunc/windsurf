  Has the plaintiff established eligibility for non-economic loss and ancillary heads
  of damage under the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), and how should aggravated and exemplary
  damages be characterised.

  and limited?

  Rule.

  Part Victorian statutory damages part (Pt Victorian Bar Association (VBA)) requires
  a "significant injury" certificate unless an exception applies.

  Sections 28LB-28LK prescribe the process.

  s 28LF defines thresholds (generally >5% Whole person impairment (WPI) for physical
  injury, extra criteria for psychiatric impairment via s 28LJ).

  Application scaffold.

  Authorities map.

  Statutory hook.

  Tripwires.

  Conclusion.

  Damages depend first on breaching the Pt VBA gateway, then on meticulous application
  of statutory caps and proper distinction between compensatory (aggravated) and punitive
  (exemplary) remedies.

  mindful of Gray''''s restraint.

  Exam tip: sequence issues -> rules -> application -> conclusion; cite a lead authority
  and the operative section.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  Lead: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR) 562.

  Lead: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562.

  __HD__3__

  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.

  __HD__4__

  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps

  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

  __HD__5__

  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: "MLS damages questions reward disciplined sequencing. Begin with the\n\
  \  Pt VBA gate: cite s 28LC(2)(a) to see if intentional or sexual misconduct bypasses\n\
  \  the certificate, otherwise run the s 28LF/LJ metrics. Only after eligibility\
  \ do\n  you price the claim—loss of earnings cap (s 28F(2)) and the indexed non-economic\n\
  \  ceiling (s 28G/s 28H). Answers that recite stale dollar figures lose marks; flag\n\
  \  that caps are indexed annually. Distinguish aggravated (compensatory) from exemplary\n\
  \  (punitive) using Uren, Lamb and Gray, and note Ibbett to show punitive awards\
  \ still\n  bite against the State. Mention Fontin to avoid conflating provocation\
  \ with mitigation\n  of compensatory damages. This scaffold helps you survive time\
  \ pressure and signals\n  policy awareness around insurance affordability versus\
  \ claimant vindication.\n\n  \n"
mnemonic: "THRESH→CAP→CHAR→POLICY: Threshold (s 28LC/28LF) → Caps (s 28F; s 28G/H)\n\
  \  → Characterise (Aggravated vs Exemplary; Gray) → Policy (insurance vs deterrance).\n"

- '**Gateway swap**: Confusing TAC ''''serious injury'''' with Wrongs Act ''''significant
  injury''''.'
- Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps
