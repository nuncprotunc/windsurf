how should you apply that distinction in a Victorian negligence problem?: {}

  Issue.
  Separate duty existence from scope so Victorian negligence stays sequenced before breach or causation.
  
  Rule.
  Existence turns on foreseeability filtered by salient features and coherence (Sullivan v Moody; Perre; Woolcock). Graham Barclay Oysters ties public authorities to statutory purpose, while Crimmins, Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra, and Tame/Annetts show omissions or psychiatric harm demand control or assumed responsibility.
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Existence: map foreseeability, salient features, and coherence before naming duty. 2) If satisfied, define scope by isolating the risk, actors, and setting. 3) Analyse breach via Wrongs Act s 48, then causation/scope under s 51 with interveners.
  
  Authorities map.
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 48, 51, 54; Pt VBA caps/thresholds; Pt IVAA proportionate liability; consider ACL s 18 for concurrent statutory claims.
  
  Tripwires.
  Avoid importing the Shirt calculus into existence, collapsing scope into s 51, or skipping coherence checks; keep psychiatric-harm and omission gates tight.
  
  Conclusion.
  Sequence existence → scope → breach → causation → remedy to show doctrinal discipline and statutory literacy.
  
why_it_matters: |
  Examiners reward sequenced answers: existence before scope, then
    breach (s 48), then causation (s 51). This avoids conflation and shows statutory
    literacy (Pt VBA caps; CN; volenti). Referencing Sullivan, Perre/Woolcock, Modbury
    and public-authority coherence earns marks for policy discipline and accuracy.

tripwires:
  - "Conflating existence with scope instead of treating sequentially."
  - "Importing the Shirt breach calculus into the duty inquiry."
  - "Ignoring omissions or psychiatric-harm limits when framing existence."
  - "Failing to anchor statutory defences (s 54) or damages caps (Pt VBA) once duty is found."
