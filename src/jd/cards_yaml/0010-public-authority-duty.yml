  Issue.
  When should a Victorian court recognise a private-law duty of care owed by a public authority to the plaintiff?

  Rule.
  Foreseeability is necessary but not sufficient. Duty turns on salient features constrained by institutional and statutory coherence; the policy/operational distinction is a filter, not an immunity. Central indicators include the authority’s control, knowledge, assumption/responsibility, reliance/vulnerability, resource allocation limits, and risks of indeterminate liability. Key authorities: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562, 579–580 [49]–[53]; Pyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330, [347]–[349], [355]–[357].

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Run the statutory coherence gate: identify the empowering scheme, its purpose/limits, and any preconditions.
  (2) Characterise the impugned act/omission (policy vs operational) and any specific undertaking or control.
  (3) Evaluate salient features: control, vulnerability/reliance, knowledge, indeterminacy, autonomy, and third-party agency.
  (4) Check statutory purpose, resource allocation provisions, and Charter coherence before extending duty.
  (5) Supporting authorities: Hunter and New England Local Health District v McKenna (2014) 253 CLR 270, 279–284 [17]–[40]; Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra (2009) 237 CLR 215, 230–236 [43]–[81]; Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258, [103].

  Authorities map.
  - Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562 — coherence limits on recognising new duties.
  - Pyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330 — fire inspection duties; policy/operational calibration.
  - Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra (2009) 237 CLR 215 — control and statutory preconditions.
  - Hunter and New England Local Health District v McKenna (2014) 253 CLR 270 — statutory coherence and resource constraints.
  - Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258, [103] — salient-features synthesis (persuasive).

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 (general negligence); ss 83–85 (public-authority principles, resource and responsibility filters).
  - Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) ss 7, 21, 38 — coherence check, not a direct cause of action.

  Tripwires.
  Refer to the dedicated `tripwires` list below for recurring public authority duty pitfalls before finalising any argument.

  Conclusion.
  No standing duty exists; recognition is most likely where the authority undertook or controlled a specific operational function, knew of a discrete risk to a vulnerable plaintiff who reasonably relied, and coherence with the empowering statute and rights framework is maintained.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems often involve councils, police, or health services. This card supplies an IRAC gateway focused on statutory coherence, policy/operational character, and salient features, avoiding common errors (assuming a rescue duty; merits-review drift; ignoring resource limits and Charter coherence). The cited pinpoints enable fast, authoritative duty analysis under exam pressure.

tripwires:
- Policy/operational distinction is not an immunity.
- No general rescue duty exists for public authorities.
- Statutory purpose/resource limits must be considered.
- Charter coherence is essential before duty extension.
