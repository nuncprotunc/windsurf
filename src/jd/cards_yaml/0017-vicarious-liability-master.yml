front: "In a vicarious liability problem, how do you determine whether an employer"
back: |
  Issue.
  When can a defendant (typically an employer) be held liable for torts committed by another?
  Rule.
  Vicarious liability applies where (1) the tortfeasor is an employee (not an independent contractor) and (2) the tort occurred in the course of employment.
  Classification uses a multifactorial test: control, integration, delegation, tools, risk allocation, remuneration (Stevens v Brodribb (1986) 160 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 16, 29-30).
  Application scaffold.
  1) Classify worker: apply multifactorial indicators.
  assess business integration and economic dependence.
  2) Connect the tort to employment: proximity to duties, benefit to employer, enterprise risk.
  exclude frolics.
  3) For intentional torts (eg, battery), test unauthorised mode.
  for institutional abuse, test close connection.
  Authorities map.
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt Victorian statutory damages part (Pt Victorian Bar Association (VBA)) (damages caps) if personal injury.
  otherwise no core statutory source for liability.
  Tripwires.
  Treating any employee tort as automatically “in course”.
  Misclassifying contractors by single‑factor focus.
  Ignoring Deatons for battery.
  Confusing vicarious liability with non‑delegable duty.
  Forgetting Pt VBA caps in personal injury.
  Conclusion.

  __HD__3__
  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.
  __HD__4__
  
  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps
  
  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss
  
  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.
  __HD__5__
  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: |
  Vicarious liability is a recurrent loss‑allocation device in exams.
   High‑band answers cleanly classify worker status, connect the tort to authorised
   work, and avoid conflating vicarious liability with non‑delegable duty. Adding Pt
   VBA caps in personal injury shows statutory literacy. Policy (enterprise risk, deterrence,
   compensation) elevates analysis.
