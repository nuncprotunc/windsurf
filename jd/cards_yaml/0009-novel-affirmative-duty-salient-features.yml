  Issue.
  When facts fall outside settled categories (often involving omissions or public authorities), should a new duty of care be recognised consistent with Victorian law?
  
  Rule.
  Apply the salient-features approach (Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; (2009) 75 NSWLR 649, [103]); foreseeability is necessary but insufficient.
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Recognised category? If the scenario fits an established duty (eg, teacher–student once authority assumed: Geyer v Downs (1977) 138 CLR 91), apply that framework.
  
  Authorities map.
  Salient features: Stavar 75 NSWLR 649, [103]; Perre 198 CLR 180. Coherence constraints: Sullivan v Moody 207 CLR 562, [42].
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48, 83–85; Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (eg, s 72); Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic) s 351; Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch
  
  Tripwires.
  Treating foreseeability as sufficient for duty. Checklist-dumping all Stavar factors without identifying the decisive ones. Conflating the duty analysis with breach under s 48. Imposing affirmative duties on authorities absent control or statutory preconditions.
  
  Conclusion.
  Deliver a factor-by-factor justification showing why duty should (or should not) be recognised, then address breach, causation and damages sequentially.
  
why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems often hinge on novel or omissions duty. Markers reward:
    (1) sequencing (recognised category → salient features → coherence), (2) a public-authority
    discipline pass (Wrongs Act ss 83–85), and (3) clean separation of duty from breach
    (s 48), causation and damages. Use factor signposts as paragraph headings and justify
    why particular features decide these facts (do not checklist Stavar). Policy levers
    to mention: indeterminacy/floodgates, autonomy (no general rescue duty), statutory
    purpose and resources (coherence), and over-deterrence if courts impose broad affirmative
    duties. Tie reliance/assumption questions to ACL s 18 to show awareness of statutory
    remedies and potential duplication/conflict. If you apply this scaffold in 10–12
    minutes, you will give a principled yes/no on duty and bank H1-level structure.
