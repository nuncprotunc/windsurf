  Classify the claimant’s protected interest so correct Victorian framework and statutes
  anchor the answer before breach or remedy.

  Rule.

  Personal injury uses negligence/intentional scaffolds with material-risk warnings
  (Rogers v Whitaker) and a foreseeability floor (Chapman v Hearse).

  Property turns on exclusive possession and direct interference (Entick) with remoteness
  kept to reasonable foreseeability (Wagon Mound (No 1) .

  persuasive).

  Application scaffold.

  1) Name the factual interest and flag any overlap or consequential loss.

  2) Apply the tailored test: injury .

  duty/breach plus mental-harm gates.

  property .

  possession, directness, nuisance reasonableness, remedies.

  economic .

  salient features and coherence.

  Tripwires.

  Avoid collapsing consequential into pure economic loss, skipping Pt VBA thresholds,
  turning salient features into rigid elements, or ignoring mental-harm filters when
  reframing injury.

  Conclusion.

  Lead with the interest classification, then integrate doctrine, statutes, and coherence
  so the remedy flows logically.
