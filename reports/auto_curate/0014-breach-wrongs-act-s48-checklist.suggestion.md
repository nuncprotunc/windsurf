## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Assuming foreseeability alone suffices without proving 'not insignificant' risk.
2. Mischaracterising the risk as too broad or narrow.
3. Applying hindsight in breach analysis contrary to s 49.
4. Neglecting cost/practicality or social utility in s 48(2) assessment.

### Rationale
- Common error in breach analysis; overlooks full s 48(1) requirements.
- Risk characterisation is critical; affects the entire analysis.
- Hindsight application undermines prospective assessment; directly contravenes s 49.
- Failure to weigh these factors leads to incomplete breach analysis.

root((Breach: s 48 + Shirt))
  A. Issue
    Specific risk (not-insignificant)
  B. Rule
    s 48(1)–(2) governs breach
    Shirt calculus (reasonable precautions)
    Prospective, time-sliced; no hindsight (s 49)
  C. Application
    Weigh (a) probability • (b) seriousness • (c) burden/cost • (d) social utility
    Specify practicable precautions
    Apply qualifiers: obvious/inherent/professional (ss 53–56)
  D. Authorities
    Wyong v Shirt
    Tapp; Dederer/Vairy
  E. Statute
    Wrongs Act s 48
    s 49; ss 53–56
    s 54; s 55
