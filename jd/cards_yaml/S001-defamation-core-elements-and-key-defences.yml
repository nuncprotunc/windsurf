  Issue.
  Defamation law in Victoria under the Defamation Act 2005 (Vic) includes extended elements, defences, remedies and statutory constraints. Apply in sequence and with updated statutory references. **Core Elements & Statutory Constraints** 1.
  - Justification (s 25): substantially true. - Contextual Truth (s 26): extra imputations not causing further harm. - Honest Opinion (s 31): based on proper material, indicated
  basis. - Qualified Privilege (s 30) and constitutional qualified privilege (Lange).
  - Innocent Dissemination (s 32) (note: distinct from ss 10C–10D frameworks). - Public Interest (s 29A): publication concerning an issue of public interest with reasonable
  
  
  Rule.
  
  Application scaffold.
  
  Authorities map.
  
  Statutory hook.

  Conclusion.
  
why_it_matters: |
  This topic is exam‑central: many hypotheticals test updated constraints
    (serious harm s 10A; single publication s 10AA; concerns notice ss 12A–12B; public
    interest defence s 29A; digital intermediaries ss 10C–10D). To score H1, apply all
    relevant provisions systematically and integrate recent High Court authority (Defteros
    on publication; Trkulja on identification). Policy tensions include Charter s 15
    (expression) vs reputation; filtering trivial claims via s 10A vs chilling speech.
    Avoid obsolete references (e.g., triviality s 33 — repealed).
