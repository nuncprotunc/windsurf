front: "How do courts distinguish the existence of a duty of care from its scope, and how should you apply that distinction in a Victorian negligence problem?"

  Issue.
  Separate duty existence from scope so Victorian negligence stays sequenced before breach or causation.

  Rule.
    - Existence turns on foreseeability filtered by salient features and coherence (Sullivan v Moody, Perre, Woolcock).
    - Graham Barclay Oysters ties public authorities to statutory purpose.
    - Crimmins, Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra, and Tame/Annetts show omissions or psychiatric harm demand control or assumed responsibility.

  Application scaffold.
    (1) Existence: map foreseeability, salient features, and coherence before naming duty.
    (2) If satisfied, define scope by isolating the risk, actors, and setting.
    (3) Analyse breach via Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48, then causation/scope under s 51 with interveners.

  Authorities map.
    - Sullivan v Moody — Coherence filter for duty existence.
    - Perre v Apand — Salient features approach.
    - Graham Barclay Oysters — Public authority duties.
    - Crimmins/Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra — Omissions and control.

  Statutory hook.
    - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 48, 51, 54.
    - Pt VBA (damages caps/thresholds).
    - Pt IVAA (proportionate liability).
    - Consider ACL s 18 for concurrent claims.

  Tripwires.
    - Importing Shirt calculus into existence analysis.
    - Collapsing scope into s 51 causation.
    - Missing coherence checks for public authorities.
    - Overlooking psychiatric-harm/omission gates.
    - Ignoring statutory defences (s 54) or damages caps (Pt VBA).

  Conclusion.
  Sequence: existence → scope → breach → causation → remedy. Show doctrinal discipline and statutory literacy.
