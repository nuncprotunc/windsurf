# 0009-novel-affirmative-duty-salient-features.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Assuming foreseeability alone establishes duty.
2. Failing to distinguish between established and novel duties.
3. Neglecting public authority considerations in duty analysis.
4. Confusing breach with duty under Wrongs Act s 48.

### Rationale
- Foreseeability is necessary but not sufficient for duty recognition.
- It's crucial to classify duties correctly to apply the salient features approach.
- Public authority factors are essential in determining duty scope.
- Breach must be kept distinct from duty to avoid confusion.

```mermaid
mindmap
root((Duty of care recognition))
  A. Issue
    Recognised category or novel?
  B. Rule
    Foreseeability necessary, not sufficient
    Salient features: vulnerability • control/reliance • indeterminacy
    Coherence constraint
  C. Application
    Classify duties; isolate decisive features
    Public authority: statute purpose • policy/operational • resources
    Conclude on duty; keep breach (s 48) separate
  D. Authorities
    Stavar (salient features)
    Crimmins (public-body factors)
    Perre (vulnerability/indeterminacy)
  E. Statute
    Wrongs Act s 48 (breach distinct)
    Wrongs Act ss 83–85 (public-authority principles)
```
