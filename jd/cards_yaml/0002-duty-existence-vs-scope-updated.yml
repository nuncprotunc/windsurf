front: "How do courts distinguish the existence of a duty of care from its scope, and how should you apply that distinction in a Victorian negligence problem?"
back: |
  Issue — Separate duty existence from scope so Victorian negligence stays sequenced before breach or causation.

  Rule —
  - Existence turns on foreseeability filtered by salient features and coherence (Sullivan v Moody, Perre, Woolcock).
  - Graham Barclay Oysters ties public authorities to statutory purpose.
  - Crimmins, Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra, and Tame/Annetts show omissions or psychiatric harm demand control or assumed responsibility.

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Existence: map foreseeability, salient features, and coherence before naming duty.
  (2) If satisfied, define scope by isolating the risk, actors, and setting.
  (3) Analyse breach via Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48, then causation/scope under s 51 with interveners.

  Authorities map —
  - Sullivan v Moody — Coherence filter for duty existence.
  - Perre v Apand — Salient features approach.
  - Graham Barclay Oysters — Public authority duties.
  - Crimmins/Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra — Omissions and control.

  Statutory hook —
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 48, 51, 54.
  - Pt VBA (damages caps/thresholds).
  - Pt IVAA (proportionate liability).
  - Consider ACL s 18 for concurrent claims.

  Tripwires —
  - Importing Shirt calculus into existence analysis.
  - Collapsing scope into s 51 causation.
  - Missing coherence checks for public authorities.
  - Overlooking psychiatric-harm/omission gates.
  - Ignoring statutory defences (s 54) or damages caps (Pt VBA).

  Conclusion — Sequence: existence → scope → breach → causation → remedy. Show doctrinal discipline and statutory literacy.

      Issue
        Keep existence distinct from scope
      Existence
        Foreseeability + salient features
        Coherence discipline (Sullivan v Moody)
        Public authority: statute purpose/control (Crimmins / Graham Barclay)
      Scope
        Define the risk embraced by the duty
        Context & actors (limit the risk)
        Statutory limits / coherence
      Application
        Sequence: existence → scope → s 48 breach
        Then s 51 causation (don't collapse)
      Anchors
        Cases: Sullivan; Perre/Woolcock; Crimmins
        Statutes: Wrongs Act ss 48, 51; Pt IVAA

tripwires:
  - "Importing Shirt factors into duty existence (breach lives in s 48)."
  - "Collapsing scope into causation (s 51) — define the risk the duty embraces first."
  - "Public-authority drift: extending duty without a statutory-purpose/coherence check (Sullivan; Graham Barclay)."
  - "Omissions/psychiatric shortcuts: skipping control/assumption/reliance/vulnerability gates (Crimmins/Stuart/Tame–Annetts)."
