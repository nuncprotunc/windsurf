front: "Shopkeeper/police detention: classify battery, assault, false imprisonment,\n\
  \  authority and remedies?\n"
back: 'Issue.

  In detention fact patterns, which trespass torts arise (battery, assault, false
  imprisonment) and is the restraint justified by statutory authority or consent?

  __HD__0__

  Battery is direct, voluntary contact without lawful justification (Williams v Milotin
  (1957) 97 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 465, 474).

  Assault requires conduct causing reasonable apprehension of imminent unlawful contact
  (Zanker v Vartzokas (1988) 34 A Crim R 11, 18).

  __HD__1__

  1) Identify the trespass type: total restraint (FI), contact (battery), or apprehension
  (assault).

  2) Test statutory power preconditions (reasonable suspicion/grounds, arrestable
  offence, necessity, proportional force).

  3) Check entry authority and implied licence limits.

  unlawful entry taints subsequent restraint.

  Requiring hostility for battery.

  Ignoring the onus shift once restraint is shown.

  Treating mere suspicion as reasonable grounds.

  Overlooking implied-licence limits on entry.

  __HD__4__

  Classify the trespass, demand statutory justification, scrutinise force and entry,
  then articulate remedies and potential aggravated/exemplary damages when authority
  is exceeded.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.
