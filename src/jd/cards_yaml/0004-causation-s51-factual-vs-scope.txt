  Issue.
  Has D's negligence factually caused P's harm, and should responsibility extend to that harmâ€”applying Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 51â€“52 without conflating stages?

  Rule.
    - Factual causation (s 51(a)) asks whether negligence was a necessary condition; apply but-for with robust inference; possibilities do not suffice.
    - Section 51(2) is exceptionalâ€”use only where but-for proof fails yet responsibility remains appropriate.
    - After-the-event counterfactuals attract strict scrutiny: s 51â€“(4).
    - Scope of liability (s 52) then asks whether it is appropriate to extend responsibility to the harm; focus on the risk the duty addressed and intervening conduct.

  Application scaffold.
    (1) Define the precise harm/mechanism.
    (2) Prove but-for by evidence/inference (Strong); exclude speculation (Amaca).
    (3) Only if proof fails, justify s 51.
    (4) For s 52, identify that risk and test normative limits (Wallace), including third-party acts/multiple causes (Seltsam).

  Authorities map.
    - Strong v Woolworths Ltd (2012) 246 CLR 182, [5]â€“[9] â€” Proof by inference and but-for test.
    - Amaca Pty Ltd v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36, [49] â€” Excludes speculation in causation.
    - Wallace v Kam (2013) 250 CLR 375 â€” Normative limits on scope of liability.
  Statutory hook.
    - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 51(1)(a), 51(2), 51(3)â€“(4); s 52.
    - Link but-for to s 51(a), exceptions to s 51, and normative scope to s 52.

  Tripwires.
    - Using s 51 as a shortcut.
    - Collapsing factual causation and scope.
    - Ignoring s 51â€“(4) on counterfactuals.
    - Assuming third-party crime within scope.

  Conclusion.
  Decide s 51(a) (or justified s 51) first, then apply s 52 to confine responsibility to the risk addressed.

why_it_matters: |
  Sequencing s 51(a) but-for â†’ s 51 exceptional â†’ s 52 scope avoids conflation; Strong/Amaca model inference versus speculation, Wallace frames normative limits, and Seltsam shows handling multiple causes.
