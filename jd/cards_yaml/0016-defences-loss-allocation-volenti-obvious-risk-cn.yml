back: 'Issue.

  How do Wrongs Act defences.

  volenti, obvious/inherent risk, and contributory negligence.

  alter liability and damages in Victorian negligence problems?

  Rule.

  Volenti demands proof that P freely and voluntarily accepted the legal risk, not
  mere awareness (Rootes v Shelton (1967) 116 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth
  Law Reports (CLR)) 383.

  Scanlon v American Cigarette (No 3) [1987] Victorian Reports (Victorian Reports
  (VR)) 289).

  Application scaffold.

  1) Test for inherent risk (s 55): if truly unavoidable by reasonable care, claim
  barred.

  check warnings via s 50/s 55(3) and plaintiff onus under s 56.

  Authorities map.

  Volenti: Rootes v Shelton.

  Scanlon.

  Obvious/inherent risk: Wrongs Act ss 53-56.

  Cole v South Tweed Heads.

  Joslyn v Berryman.

  Contributory negligence/apportionment: Pennington.

  Podrebersek.

  Bankstown Foundry.

  Statutory hook.

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 50, 53-56, 62-63, s 14G.

  Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) s 139A.

  Tripwires.

  Treating obvious risk as an automatic duty negation.

  Equating awareness with volenti without proof of legal-risk acceptance.

  Ignoring s 56 onus when alleging failure to warn.

  Skipping s 14G in intoxication/illegality fact patterns.

  Conclusion.

  Only genuine volenti or inherent-risk bars defeat liability.

  otherwise damages are scaled “just and equitable” under s 26, with statutory modifiers
  (s 63, s 14G) calibrating outcomes.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  Lead: Rootes v Shelton (1967) 116 CLR 383.

  __HD__3__

  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 50, 53–56, 62–63, s 14G.

  __HD__4__

  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps

  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

  __HD__5__

  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

tripwires:
- Treating obvious risk as automatic duty removal.
- Equating awareness with volenti without legal-risk acceptance.
- Skipping s 56 onus in warning disputes.
- Ignoring s 14G in intoxication/illegality scenarios.
- Apportioning CN without culpability/causal potency reasons.
- Overlooking s 63’s potential for claim-defeating CN.
