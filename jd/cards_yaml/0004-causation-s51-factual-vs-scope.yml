  Issue.
  Has D’s negligence factually caused P’s harm and should liability extend to that harm under the Wrongs Act without collapsing factual causation into scope of liability?
  
  Rule.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(1)(a) keeps factual causation as a “necessary condition” test and excludes self-serving hypotheticals unless against interest (s 51(3)–(4)).
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Factual causation — deploy but-for, build circumstantial inference (Strong v Woolworths (2012) 246 CLR 182, [5]–[9]), reject mere possibilities (Amaca v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36, [49]).
  
  Authorities map.
  But-for and inference: Strong 246 CLR 182, [5]–[9]; Amaca 246 CLR 36, [49]; March 171 CLR 506. Exceptional restraint: Adeels 239 CLR 420, [52]–[57].
  
  Statutory hook.
  
  Tripwires.
  Treating s 51(2) as a generic “material increase in risk” escape hatch. Collapsing factual causation and scope. Assuming third-party crime stays within scope without proving but-for.
  
  Conclusion.
  Prove factual causation under s 51(1)(a) (resisting s 51(2) shortcuts), then decide scope under s 52 with authority-driven analysis before turning to apportionment or defences.
  
why_it_matters: |
  Examiners penalise conflation. Sequencing s 51(1)(a) but-for → s
    51(2) exceptional → s 52 scope lets you deploy the right authority at each node.
    Strong/Amaca show how to build or resist inference; Adeels limits shortcuts; Wallace
    frames the normative limb; Mahony and Haber keep you honest on medical negligence
    and suicide.
