front: What are the key elements required to form a valid contract at common law?
back: 'Issue. Decide whether parties have formed a binding contract or are still negotiating.
  Rule. Formation turns on offer, acceptance, consideration, intention, and certainty.
  Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co [1893] 1 QB 256 shows unilateral offers accepted
  by performance. R v Clarke (1927) 40 CLR 227 reminds that acceptance requires knowledge
  of the offer. Consideration must be sufficient (Chappell v Nestle [1960] AC 87)
  and not past (Roscorla v Thomas (1842) 3 QB 234). Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR
  353 categorises agreements to agree. Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community (2002)
  209 CLR 95 confirms intention is inferred from context, with presumptions reversed
  for commercial vs domestic deals. Application scaffold. 1) Identify the communication
  and classify it as offer or invitation. 2) Confirm acceptance mirrors the offer,
  was communicated (allow for postal vs instantaneous rules), and was made with knowledge
  of the offer (R v Clarke). 3) Test consideration: fresh value, no past acts, deed
  where consideration is missing. 4) Ask whether parties meant legal force, drawing
  on Ermogenous factors. 5) Test certainty using Masters v Cameron machinery and supply
  of terms; salvage vagueness only if objective standards exist. 6) If formation fails,
  consider estoppel (Waltons Stores v Maher (1988) 164 CLR 387) or restitution. Statutory
  overlay. Australian Consumer Law (Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2)
  s 18 polices misleading conduct and ss 23–24 void unfair terms. Contracts Review
  Act 1980 (NSW) ss 7–9 offers persuasive relief for unjust bargains. Charter of Human
  Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) s 13(a) feeds fairness arguments. Remedies.
  Once formation is proven, primary relief is expectation damages (Robinson v Harman
  (1848) 1 Exch 850) with reliance (McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951)
  84 CLR 377) or equitable orders where damages are inadequate. Conclusion. Sequence
  each element, reference Carlill, Masters v Cameron, R v Clarke, and Ermogenous in
  the body, then integrate statutory levers and remedies to close the loop.'
why_it_matters: 'Exam problems often hide formation traps: invitations to treat dressed
  as offers, past consideration, domestic promises, or conditional deals. Run the
  element checklist, cite Carlill, Masters v Cameron, R v Clarke, and Ermogenous,
  then pivot to ACL unfair-terms or Contracts Review Act relief if the bargain bites.
  Wrap by flagging estoppel or reliance damages if formation collapses.

tripwires:
- Confusing invitation to treat with an offer.
- Treating past consideration as valid.
- Ignoring domestic presumption against intention.
- Assuming vague terms are enforceable without Masters v Cameron machinery.
- Forgetting estoppel or restitution when formation fails.
- Skipping ACL or Contracts Review Act scrutiny.
