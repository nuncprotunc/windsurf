front: 'Defences (Vic): when do volenti, obvious/inherent risk, and contributory negligence
  reshape liability and damages?'
back: 'Issue. How do Wrongs Act defences—volenti, obvious/inherent risk, and contributory
  negligence—alter liability and damages in Victorian negligence problems?


  Rule. Volenti demands proof that P freely and voluntarily accepted the legal risk,
  not mere awareness (Rootes v Shelton (1967) 116 CLR 383; Scanlon v American Cigarette
  (No 3) [1987] VR 289). Obvious and inherent risk provisions (Wrongs Act ss 53–56)
  create presumptions (s 54) and onus shifts (s 56) but do not replace negligence
  standards; s 55 bars claims where the risk could not have been avoided by reasonable
  care, subject to warning duties (s 55(3); s 50). Contributory negligence and apportionment
  run under ss 26, 62–63, comparing culpability and causal potency (Pennington v Norris
  (1956) 96 CLR 10; Podrebersek v AIS (1985) 59 ALJR 492). Statutory modifications
  address intoxication/illegality (s 14G) and permit up to 100% reduction (s 63).
  Recreational waivers engage ACL/CCA s 139A limits.


  Application scaffold. 1) Test for inherent risk (s 55): if truly unavoidable by
  reasonable care, claim barred; check warnings via s 50/s 55(3) and plaintiff onus
  under s 56. 2) Evaluate volenti: require evidence of informed acceptance of the
  legal risk (rare outside explicit waivers); rebut s 54 presumptions where appropriate.
  3) If liability persists, assess contributory negligence: identify plaintiff breaches
  via s 62 standard, adjust for context (employment pressures: Bankstown Foundry v
  Braistina (1986) 160 CLR 301; intoxication: Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34). 4)
  Apportion under s 26 with reasons anchored in culpability and causal potency (Pennington;
  Podrebersek), noting potential claim-defeating CN (s 63) and recreational waivers
  (Cole v South Tweed Heads (2004) 217 CLR 469; CCA s 139A).


  Authorities map. Volenti: Rootes v Shelton; Scanlon. Obvious/inherent risk: Wrongs
  Act ss 53–56; Cole v South Tweed Heads; Joslyn v Berryman. Contributory negligence/apportionment:
  Pennington; Podrebersek; Bankstown Foundry. Statutory overlays: Wrongs Act ss 26,
  50, 55, 56, 62–63, s 14G; CCA 2010 (Cth) s 139A (ACL).


  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 50, 53–56, 62–63, s 14G; Competition
  and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) s 139A.


  Tripwires. Treating obvious risk as an automatic duty negation. Equating awareness
  with volenti without proof of legal-risk acceptance. Ignoring s 56 onus when alleging
  failure to warn. Skipping s 14G in intoxication/illegality fact patterns. Apportioning
  CN without explicit culpability/causal potency reasons. Overlooking s 63’s capacity
  for 100% reduction.


  Conclusion. Only genuine volenti or inherent-risk bars defeat liability; otherwise
  damages are scaled “just and equitable” under s 26, with statutory modifiers (s
  63, s 14G) calibrating outcomes.

why_it_matters: 'Examiners expect a disciplined defence sequence: inherent risk, volenti,
  statutory presumptions, then reasoned contributory negligence apportionment. This
  structure shows command of Wrongs Act defences and the policy tension between personal
  responsibility and protective duties.
