  Issue.
  What frame governs premises injury in Victoria: occupiers’ liability (Pt IIA), ordinary negligence, or trespass?
  
  Rule.
  Part IIA abolishes entrant categories and imposes a statutory duty: take reasonable care so entrants are not injured by the state of the premises or things done/omitted in relation to that state (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 14B(3)); otherwise common law continues (s 14B(2)).
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Classify hazard: “state/things done” → apply s 14B(3). 2) Breach: run s 48 (foreseeable, not insignificant, reasonable precautions), with obvious/inherent risk and volenti overlays (ss 53–56).
  
  Authorities map.
  Duty source: Zaluzna 162 CLR 479, 488; s 14B(2)–(3). Contractors/activity hazards: Thompson 221 CLR 234, [23]–[27]. Trespassers: Hackshaw 155 CLR 614, 654 (Deane J).
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 14B(2)–(3); s 48; s 51; ss 53–56.
  
  Tripwires.
  Reviving invitee/licensee categories post‑Zaluzna. Treating activity hazards as outside s 14B(3). Ignoring obvious‑risk provisions in breach. Assuming causation without inspection evidence (Strong). Denying any duty to trespassers (Hackshaw).
  
  Conclusion.
  
why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems mix premises hazards, activity risks and trespassers.
    High‑band answers: (i) source the duty in Pt IIA, (ii) use Pt X for breach/causation,
    (iii) avoid pre‑Zaluzna categories, (iv) use Thompson for activity hazards, (v)
    use Strong to prove causation, and (vi) pivot to trespass when force, not premises,
    causes the injury. This sequencing respects statutory integration and saves marks.
