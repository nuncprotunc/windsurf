front: What factors determine whether interference is unreasonable in private nuisance?
back: 'In private nuisance, the question is whether the defendant''s interference
  with the plaintiff''s use or enjoyment of land is unreasonable. Courts apply a multi-factorial
  test, balancing competing land uses.


  **Sensitivity of Plaintiff** – Only ordinary sensitivity is protected (*Robinson
  v Kilvert* (1889) 41 Ch D 88 at 96 (CA)).


  **Locality** – Reasonableness depends on neighbourhood character (*Sturges v Bridgman*
  (1879) 11 Ch D 852 at 865 (CA)); planning permits and zoning schemes may affect
  this assessment.


  **Duration & Frequency** – Persistent interference is more likely actionable (*Munro
  v Southern Dairies Ltd* [1955] VLR 332 at 336 (VSC)); temporary events rarely suffice.


  **Utility of Defendant''s Conduct** – Public benefit does not excuse a nuisance
  (*Bamford v Turnley* (1862) 122 ER 25 at 32–3 (Ex Ch)).


  **Malice** – Deliberate interference tips the balance (*Hollywood Silver Fox Farm
  Ltd v Emmett* [1936] 2 KB 468 at 476 (CA)).


  **Type of Harm** – Physical damage (*Sedleigh-Denfield v O''Callaghan* [1940] AC
  880 at 903 (HL)) or amenity interference such as noise/odour (*Bone v Seale* [1975]
  1 WLR 797 at 804 (CA)).


  **Australian Authorities**: *Hargrave v Goldman* (1963) 110 CLR 40 at 66–7 (HCA)
  (liability to abate natural hazards); *Pullen v Gutteridge Haskins & Davey Pty Ltd*
  [1993] 1 VR 27 at 34–5 (VSC, nuisance from construction); *Fennell v Robson Excavations
  Pty Ltd* (1977) 136 CLR 444 at 456 (HCA, blasting dust/noise); *Butt v M''Donald*
  (1896) 7 QLJ 68 (QSC, planning/environment interaction).


  **Remedies**: Damages (compensatory), injunctions (subject to the *Shelfer* proportionality
  test, where damages may be substituted: *Shelfer v City of London Electric Lighting
  Co* [1895] 1 Ch 287 at 322 (CA)), damages in lieu of injunction under *Supreme Court
  Act 1986* (Vic) s 38, and abatement (self-help must be proportionate, with notice
  and minimal force).


  **Defences**: Statutory authority under *Wrongs Act 1958* (Vic) pt XII ss 83–85
  (public authorities not liable if acting within authority unless negligence shown);
  prescription (20 years'' uninterrupted nuisance); contributory negligence.


  **Statutory Overlays**: *Wrongs Act 1958* (Vic); *Environment Protection Act 2017*
  (Vic) pt 5.3 (noise/odour controls, s 166 environmental noise); *Charter of Human
  Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006* (Vic) (balancing rights to privacy and home
  life).

why_it_matters: 'Private nuisance is a frequent MLS exam topic because it forces candidates
  to balance doctrine, remedies, and statutory overlays. The unreasonableness test
  is inherently contextual: sensitivity, locality, duration, utility, malice, and
  type of harm must be weighed against modern statutory frameworks. Fact patterns
  often place students in "borderline" situations — eg, construction works near homes,
  licensed venues with noise permits, or odours regulated under EPA licences.


  Examiners reward answers that integrate both English principles and Australian apex
  authority (Hargrave, Fennell, Pullen). Remedy choice is examinable: injunctions
  are not automatic and may be refused if damages suffice (per Shelfer); damages in
  lieu are statutorily authorised; abatement must be proportionate and carefully applied.


  Policy coherence is key: nuisance must fit alongside environmental regulation and
  planning approvals. Courts weigh individual rights to exclusive possession against
  broader social and economic utility. Human rights overlays under the Charter can
  further complicate the balance. Candidates who demonstrate this statutory–common
  law interaction and identify exam pitfalls (eg, assuming public benefit is a defence)
  will achieve H1-level coherence and depth.

tripwires:
- Confusing nuisance with trespass (direct vs indirect interference)
- Ignoring remedies or defaulting to damages only
- Assuming public benefit is a defence
- Treating extraordinary sensitivity as actionable
- Overlooking statutory authority defence under Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic)
- Forgetting malice can make lawful conduct unreasonable
- Neglecting proportionality in injunctions (Shelfer test)
- Omitting statutory overlays (EPA, Charter, planning permits)
