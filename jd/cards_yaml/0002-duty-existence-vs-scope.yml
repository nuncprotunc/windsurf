front: How do courts distinguish the existence of a duty of care from its scope, and
  how should you apply that distinction in a Victorian negligence problem?
back: 'Existence and scope are distinct but connected stages in negligence. Existence
  asks whether any duty is owed to the plaintiff; scope asks what the duty required
  in the circumstances. Treat them sequentially in exams to avoid conflation.


  **Existence** turns on foreseeability and relationship reasoning, tempered by coherence
  and policy. Foreseeability is the gateway: *Sullivan v Moody* [2001] HCA 59, 207
  CLR 562, 576 [50] (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne JJ) emphasised coherence;
  *Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan* [2002] HCA 54, 211 CLR 540, 579 [79] (McHugh
  J) stressed public authority discretion. Salient features such as vulnerability,
  control, assumption of responsibility and indeterminacy guide duty recognition:
  *Perre v Apand Pty Ltd* [1999] HCA 36, 198 CLR 180, 225 [118] (McHugh J); *Woolcock
  Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd* [2004] HCA 16, 216 CLR 515, 529 [23] (Gleeson
  CJ, Gummow, Hayne JJ). *Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee* [1999]
  HCA 59, 200 CLR 1 illustrates structured multi-factor analysis. Omissions generally
  attract no duty, absent special relationships: *Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra* [2009]
  HCA 15, 237 CLR 215. Psychiatric harm is recognised but constrained: *Tame v NSW*;
  *Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd* [2002] HCA 35, 211 CLR 317.


  **Scope** narrows the duty once existence is found, confining it to the precise
  risk that materialised, plaintiff''s vulnerability, and defendant''s control. *Modbury
  Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil* [2000] HCA 61, 205 CLR 254, 269 [35] (Gleeson
  CJ) illustrates limits for third-party criminality. Scope frames breach (precautions),
  causation, and defences.


  **Defences/damages**: contributory negligence (*Wrongs Act 1958* (Vic) s 26); voluntary
  assumption of risk (s 54); statutory non-economic loss thresholds and caps (Pt VBA,
  e.g. s 28ID, s 28LE); proportionate liability (Pt IVAA). Federal overlays may intersect,
  e.g. misleading conduct under *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth) sch 2 s
  18. Victorian breach overlay (s 48) governs duty/breach but does not replace the
  common law inquiry. Always distinguish existence from scope and anchor analysis
  with pinpointed authorities.

  '
why_it_matters: 'In exams, disciplined sequencing—existence before scope—earns method
  marks and prevents conflation. Existence: start with foreseeability, salient features,
  coherence, omissions and psychiatric harm limits. Then scope: confine to the risk
  that eventuated, linked to vulnerability and control, illustrated by *Modbury Triangle*.
  This scaffolds breach and causation analysis. Flag Wrongs Act s 48 to demonstrate
  statutory literacy; mentioning s 26, s 54, and Pt VBA caps (s 28ID, s 28LE) shows
  awareness of defences and damages. Adding Pt IVAA proportionate liability and ACL
  s 18 demonstrates breadth beyond state law. Policy tensions—indeterminacy, resource
  allocation, chilling effects on public authorities, reluctance to expand novel duties
  post-*Sullivan*—signal H1-level engagement. Structured treatment avoids importing
  the *Shirt* calculus into duty and ensures a coherent, defensible answer under time
  pressure.

tripwires:
- Conflating existence with scope instead of treating sequentially
- Importing the Shirt breach calculus into duty analysis
- Ignoring omissions/psychiatric harm limits when framing existence
- Failing to anchor statutory defences (s 54) or damages caps (s 28ID, s 28LE)
- Overlooking Commonwealth overlays (ACL s 18) for breadth
- Neglecting policy tensions (indeterminacy, coherence, chilling effects)
