the said publication did not arise from want of due care or caution on his

     (1)     In any proceeding involving an
apportionable claim&#8212;

         (a)     the liability of a defendant who is a concurrent wrongdoer in relation
to that claim is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the loss or
damage claimed that the court considers just having regard to the extent of the
defendant's responsibility for the loss or damage; and

         (b)     judgment must not be given against the defendant for more than that

accordance with this Part; and

         (b)     liability for the other claim is to be determined in accordance with

recovered judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part of
any loss or damage from bringing another action against any other concurrent
wrongdoer for that loss or damage.

     (2)     However, in any proceeding in respect of any such action the plaintiff
cannot recover an amount of damages that, having regard to any damages
previously recovered by the plaintiff in respect of the loss or damage, would
result in the plaintiff receiving compensation for loss or damage that is
greater than the loss or damage actually suffered by the plaintiff.

care to those dependants before the time that the liability in respect of which
the claim is made arose; and

providing the care themselves because of&#8212;

week and that consecutive period of time and that need is reasonable in all the
circumstances.

     (3)     In determining the amount of damages (if any) to be awarded to
the claimant for any loss of the claimant's capacity to
provide gratuitous care to the claimant's dependants, a
court&#8212;

         (a)     may only award damages for that loss in accordance with this section
and section 28IE; and

         (b)     must not include in any damages awarded to the claimant for
non&#8209;economic loss a component that compensates the claimant for the loss
of that capacity.

     (4)     The claimant may not be awarded damages for any loss of the claimant's
capacity to provide gratuitous care to any dependant of the claimant if the
dependant has previously recovered damages in respect of that loss of
capacity.











     (5)     A person (whether or not a dependant of the claimant) may not be
awarded damages for a loss sustained by the person because of the claimant's
loss of capacity to provide gratuitous care if the claimant has previously

         (a)     its determination of the medical question in accordance with
subsection (4); or

         (b)     its certificate, in accordance with subsection (5), that it is
unable to determine the medical question but that it is satisfied that the
degree of impairment will satisfy the threshold level when the injury has
stabilised; or

         (c)     its certificate that it is unable to determine the medical question
and a statement of the time fixed for further assessment of the person under
subsection (6).

whether the degree of impairment resulting from the injury satisfies the
threshold level but must not state the specific degree of impairment.

     (5)     If, after making an assessment, the Medical Panel is unable to
determine the medical question because an injury has not stabilised, but the
Medical Panel is satisfied that the degree of impairment resulting from injury
will satisfy the threshold level once the injury has stabilised, the Medical
Panel may certify in writing to that effect.

assessment) for a further assessment of the degree of impairment of the person
to be made under this section.

     (7)     The time fixed under subsection (6) must be the earliest time by which
the Medical Panel considers that the injury will have stabilised.

General principles

     (1)     A person is not negligent in failing to
take precautions against a risk of harm unless&#8212;

         (a)     the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person
knew or ought to have known); and

         (b)     the risk was not insignificant; and

         (c)     in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position
would have taken those precautions.

     (2)     In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken
precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following
(amongst other relevant things)&#8212;

         (a)     the probability that the harm would occur if care were not
taken;

         (b)     the likely seriousness of the harm;

         (c)     the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm;

         (d)     the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of
harm.

     (3)     For the purposes of subsection (1)(b)&#8212;

         (a)     insignificant risks include, but are not limited to, risks that
are far-fetched or fanciful; and

         (b)     risks that are not insignificant are all risks other than
insignificant risks and include, but are not limited to, significant
risks.

         (a)     the burden of taking precautions to avoid a risk of harm includes the
burden of taking precautions to avoid similar risks of harm for which the person
may be responsible; and

         (b)     the fact that a risk of harm could have been avoided by doing
something in a different way does not of itself give rise to or affect liability
for the way in which the thing was done; and

         (c)     the subsequent taking of action that would (had the action been taken
earlier) have avoided a risk of harm does not of itself give rise to or affect
liability in respect of the risk and does not of itself constitute an admission
of liability in connection with the risk.

WRONGS ACT 1958

General principles

     (1)     A determination that negligence caused
particular harm comprises the following elements&#8212;

         (a)     that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the
harm (factual causation); and

         (b)     that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person's
liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability).

     (2)     In determining in an appropriate case, in accordance with established
principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary
condition of the occurrence of harm should be taken to establish factual
causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or
not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent
party.

     (3)     If it is relevant to the determination of factual causation to
determine what the person who suffered harm (the injured person) would
have done if the negligent person had not been negligent, the matter is to be
determined subjectively in the light of all relevant circumstances.

     (4)     For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court is to
consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility
for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.

Meaning of obvious risk

     (1)     For the purposes of section 54, an
obvious risk to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the
circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of
that person.

     (2)     Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common
knowledge.

     (3)     A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it
has a low probability of occurring.

     (4)     A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or
circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or
physically observable.

     (5)     To remove any doubt, it is declared that a risk from a thing,
including a living thing, is not an obvious risk if the risk is created because
of a failure on the part of a person to properly operate, maintain, replace,
prepare or care for the thing, unless the failure itself is an obvious
risk.

Voluntary assumption of risk

     (1)     If, in a proceeding on a claim for damages
for negligence, a defence of voluntary assumption of risk (volenti non fit
injuria) is raised and the risk of harm is an obvious risk, the person who
suffered harm is presumed to have been aware of the risk, unless the person
proves on the balance of probabilities that the person was not aware of the
risk.

     (2)     Subsection (1) does not apply to&#8212;

         (a)     a proceeding on a claim for damages relating to the provision of or
the failure to provide a professional service or health service; or

with work done by one person for another.

inherent risk.

     (2)     An inherent risk is a risk of something occurring that cannot
be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care.

Standard of care to be expected of persons holding out as possessing a particular skill

In a case involving an allegation of negligence
against a person (the defendant) who holds himself or herself out
as possessing a particular skill, the standard to be applied by a court in
determining whether the defendant acted with due care is, subject to this
Division, to be determined by reference to&#8212;

         (a)     what could reasonably be expected of a person possessing that skill;
and

         (b)     the relevant circumstances as at the date of the alleged negligence
and not a later date.

Standard of care for professionals

     (1)     A professional is not negligent in
providing a professional service if it is established that the professional
acted in a manner that (at the time the service was provided) was widely
accepted in Australia by a significant number of respected practitioners in the
field (peer professional opinion) as competent professional practice in
the circumstances.

     (2)     However, peer professional opinion cannot be relied on for the
purposes of this section if the court determines that the opinion is
unreasonable.

     (3)     The fact that there are differing peer professional opinions widely
accepted in Australia by a significant number of respected practitioners in the
field concerning a matter does not prevent any one or more (or all) of those
opinions being relied on for the purposes of this section.

     (4)     Peer professional opinion does not have to be universally accepted to
be considered widely accepted.

     (5)     If, under this section, a court determines peer professional opinion
to be unreasonable, it must specify in writing the reasons for that
determination.

     (6)     Subsection (5) does not apply if a jury determines the
matter.

the financial and other resources that are reasonably available to the authority

determined by reference to the broad range of its activities (and not merely by
reference to the matter to which the proceeding relates);

Wrongful exercise of or failure to exercise function

     (1)     This section applies to a proceeding for
damages for an alleged breach of statutory duty by a public authority in
connection with the exercise of or a failure to exercise a function of the
authority.

     (2)     For the purpose of the proceeding, an act or omission of the public
authority relating to a function conferred on the public authority specifically
in its capacity as a public authority does not constitute a breach of statutory
duty unless the act or omission was in the circumstances so unreasonable that no
public authority having the functions of the authority in question could
properly consider the act or omission to be a reasonable exercise of its
functions.

     (3)     For the purpose of the proceeding the public authority is not liable
for damages caused by the wrongful exercise of or failure to exercise a function
of the authority unless the provisions and policy of the enactment in which the
duty to exercise the function is created are compatible with the existence of
that liability.

     (4)     Despite subsection (1), subsection (2) does not apply to a statutory
duty that is imposed as an absolute duty on the public authority to do or not to
do a particular thing.

way.

holder, employee, owner, volunteer or contractor of the relevant organisation;
and

         (b)     if the relevant organisation is a religious organisation, includes but

WRONGS ACT 1958
- SECT 91
Liability of organisations

     (1)     This section imposes a duty of care that
forms part of a cause of action in negligence.

     (2)     A relevant organisation owes a duty to take the care that in all the
circumstances of the case is reasonable to prevent the abuse of a child by
an individual associated with the relevant organisation while the child is
under the care, supervision or authority of the relevant
organisation.

Note

See section 90 as to when an individual is associated with a relevant
organisation. In particular, section 90(1)(c) and (d) extend the meaning of that
concept in the case of delegation of the care, supervision or authority over a
child to&#8212;

        (a)     another organisation; or

        (b)     a specified carer.

     (3)     In a proceeding on a claim against a relevant organisation for damages
in respect of the abuse of a child under its care, supervision or authority, on
proof that abuse has occurred and that the abuse was committed by an individual
associated with the relevant organisation, the relevant organisation is presumed
to have breached the duty of care referred to in subsection (2) unless the
relevant organisation proves on the balance of probabilities that it took
reasonable precautions to prevent the abuse in question.

Note

Reasonable precautions will vary depending on factors including but not
limited to&#8212;

        (a)     the nature of the relevant organisation; and

        (b)     the resources that are reasonably available to the relevant
organisation; and

        (c)     the relationship between the relevant organisation and the child;
and

        (d)     whether the relevant organisation has delegated the care, supervision
or authority over the child to another organisation; and 

        (e)     the role in the organisation of the perpetrator of the abuse.

     (4)     If a claim names 2 or more relevant organisations as defendants,
subsection (3) applies to each relevant organisation separately.

     (5)     In the case of a relevant organisation that is a public sector body
within the meaning of the Public Administration Act 2004 or another
person or body acting on behalf of the State&#8212;

         (a)     if the relevant organisation is capable in law of being sued, the
relevant organisation is the appropriate defendant for the purposes of a claim
brought in reliance on the duty in subsection (2); and

         (b)     if the relevant organisation is not capable in law of being sued,
the State is the appropriate defendant for the purposes of a claim brought
in reliance on the duty in subsection (2); and

         (c)     any liability incurred by the relevant organisation by reason of
subsection (2) is incurred by the State.

     (6)     Subsection (2) does not apply to abuse of a child committed
by an individual associated with a relevant organisation in circumstances wholly
unrelated to that individual's association with the relevant
organisation.

     (7)     If a relevant organisation has delegated, by means of contract or
otherwise, the care, supervision or authority over a child to whom the
claim relates to another organisation, subsection (2) does not apply to
abuse of the child committed by an individual associated with the delegate
organisation in circumstances wholly unrelated to that individual's association
with the delegator organisation or the delegate organisation.

Entity may nominate body to be sued

     (1)     If an entity is not capable in law of
being sued, it may nominate, with the consent of the nominee, a legal person
that is so capable as the appropriate defendant for the purposes of a claim
brought in reliance on the duty in section 91 and any liability incurred by the
entity by reason of section 91(2) is incurred by the nominated legal
person.

     (2)     A nomination under subsection (1) may be made at any time, whether
before or after abuse occurs.

     (3)     If a nomination under subsection (1) is made after abuse
occurs&#8212;

         (a)     the nominating entity is taken to be a relevant organisation at the
time of the abuse; and

         (b)     any liability incurred by the entity by reason of section 91(2) is
taken to have been incurred by the nominated legal person on and from the date
of the abuse.

INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984
(ILA)

Style changes

Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out
in Schedule 1 to that Act.

References to ILA s. 39B

Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended by
the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section or
clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of
the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or
clause.

Interpretation

As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the
following effects:

&#8226;     Headings

All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed before 1
January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that
Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule;
sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms. 
See section 36(1A)(2A).

&#8226;     Examples, diagrams or notes

All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on
or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).

&#8226;     Punctuation

All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January
2001 forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was
passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B).

&#8226;     Provision numbers

All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  See
section 36(3C).

&#8226;     Location of "legislative items"

A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13
October 2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to
be at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another
legislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at
the foot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items
will be regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section
36B.

&#8226;     Other material

Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and other
material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.  See
section 36(3)(3D)(3E).

     2     Table of Amendments

This publication incorporates amendments made to the Wrongs Act 1958
by Acts and subordinate instruments.

     (1)     The Principal Act as amended by this Act shall apply only to causes of
actions which accrue after the commencement of this Act.

     (2)     The Principal Act as in force immediately before the commencement of
this Act shall continue to apply to actions which accrued on or before the

          8     Transitional provisions

Where a cause of action survives for the benefit of the estate of a
deceased person by reason of the operation of section 29 of the

that cause of action have been instituted at the date of the coming into
operation of this Act whereby damages are being claimed for the loss of future
probable earnings of the deceased person after the date of his death and where
by reason of the coming into operation of the Administration and Probate
(Survival of Actions) Act 1982 the right to recover those damages is
removed, a person&#8212;

         (a)     who would have been entitled to share in those damages had that action
been successful; and

         (b)     who would, if the deceased person had died after the coming into
operation of this Act, be entitled to bring an action under Part III of the
Wrongs Act 1958 but who would not have been entitled to bring such an
action before the coming into operation of this Act&#8212;

shall be entitled to bring an action under that Part (notwithstanding
section 20(1) of the Wrongs Act 1958) as if the deceased person had
died on the day upon which this Act comes into operation.
