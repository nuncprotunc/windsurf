  Issue.
  When does a duty arise to protect a plaintiff from relational pure economic loss triggered by third-party property damage or business interruption?

  Rule.
  The duty to avoid relational pure economic loss is exceptional. Mere foreseeability is insufficient. A salient features analysis (Perre v Apand (1999) 198 CLR 180; Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258) asks whether:
    - the plaintiff or class is determinate and known to the defendant;
    - the defendant controlled the risk or assumed responsibility;
    - the plaintiff was vulnerable, lacking reasonable contractual or insurance protections;
    - recognising the duty coheres with contractual and statutory frameworks.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Confirm the loss is pure economic loss, not consequential on physical damage to the plaintiff.
  (2) Identify a determinate, known plaintiff or class.
  (3) Establish the defendant's knowledge, control, or assumption of responsibility.
  (4) Demonstrate vulnerability: no realistic contractual, insurance, or market self-protection.
  (5) Check coherence with existing contractual allocations and statutory schemes.

  Authorities map.
  - Perre v Apand (1999) 198 CLR 180.  
  - Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258.  
  - Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge "Willemstad" (1976) 136 CLR 529.  
  - Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16.  
  - Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners SP 61288 [2014] HCA 36.

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA (proportionate liability).  
  - Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) ss 18, 236 (ACL overlay).

  Refer to the `tripwires` key for rapid-fire pitfalls.

  Conclusion.
  Evaluate determinacy, control, vulnerability, and coherence to conclude whether the salient features justify imposing a duty.

tripwires:
- Assuming pure economic loss duties arise on foreseeability alone.
- Collapsing vulnerability into mere financial exposure without self-protection analysis.
- Ignoring contractual/statutory coherence when weighing salient features.
- Treating proportionate liability or ACL overlays as duty substitutes instead of separate regimes.
