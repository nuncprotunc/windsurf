why_it_matters: |
  This topic is exam‑central: many hypotheticals test updated constraints
   (serious harm s 10A; single publication s 10AA; concerns notice ss 12A–12B; public
   interest defence s 29A; digital intermediaries ss 10C–10D). To score H1, apply all
   relevant provisions systematically and integrate recent High Court authority (Defteros
   on publication; Trkulja on identification). Policy tensions include Charter s 15
   (expression) vs reputation; filtering trivial claims via s 10A vs chilling speech.
   Avoid obsolete references (e.g., triviality s 33 — repealed).
