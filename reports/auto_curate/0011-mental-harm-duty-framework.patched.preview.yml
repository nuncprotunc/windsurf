front: "Mental harm duties (Vic): how do Wrongs Act Pt XI filters apply to rescuers, secondary victims, and workplace trauma?"

  Issue.
  Outline when the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI compels recognition of a duty to avoid mental harm for rescuers, secondary victims, and workplace psychiatric injury.

  Rule.
  Pt XI defines "mental harm" to include both pure and consequential psychiatric injury (s 72). A duty to guard against pure mental harm arises only if a person of normal fortitude would have suffered a recognised psychiatric illness that was reasonably foreseeable, assessed with the s 72(2) factors (relationship, control or assurance, absence of a sudden-shock requirement, and exposure). Consequential mental harm follows once physical injury is actionable. High Court guidance (Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317 at [118]–[122]) confirms the focus on foreseeability and recognised illness.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Classify the harm as pure or consequential mental harm.
  (2) If pure mental harm, apply the s 72(1) normal-fortitude foreseeability test using the s 72(2) factors.
  (3) Apply s 73(1)–(2) scene and relationship limits for secondary victims and confirm the derivative-claim bar in s 73(3).
  (4) Rescuers: apply Wicks v State Rail Authority of NSW (2010) 241 CLR 60 at [45]–[50] to confirm foreseeability without a sudden-shock requirement.
  (5) Workplace claims: evaluate reasonable foreseeability of psychiatric injury in the actual role context (Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd (2005) 222 CLR 44 at [36]–[40]; compare Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377 at [50]–[55]); note secondary-victim duties for close family in employer contexts (Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 269 at [30]–[35]).

  Authorities map.
  - Tame/Annetts — Foreseeability and normal fortitude; no sudden-shock rule.
  - Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549 at [60]–[65] — Secondary-victim parameters.
  - Gifford — Family secondary duty in employer settings.
  - Wicks — Rescuers.
  - Koehler — Workplace psychiatric injury.
  - Naidu — Workplace bullying (NSWCA persuasive guidance).

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (Mental Harm) ss 72–75.
  - Wrongs Act ss 48 and 51 (breach and causation once duty is recognised).
  - Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) s 79 (expert evidence gatekeeping).

  Tripwires.
  Consult the `tripwires` list below for recurring pitfalls (normal fortitude, sudden shock, s 73 limits, derivative-bar issues, and psychiatric-diagnosis requirements).

  Conclusion.
  Duty recognition under Pt XI hinges on foreseeable psychiatric illness to a person of normal fortitude with s 73 limits satisfied; once duty is set, proceed to breach and causation under ss 48 and 51.

why_it_matters: |
  Pt XI questions dominate exam fact patterns on rescuers, secondary victims, and occupational stress. This scaffold forces fast classification, applies the correct statutory foreseeability filter, and avoids reviving discredited sudden-shock controls, while flagging expert-evidence and derivative-claim traps.

  CLASSIFY → FORESEE → s 73 GATE → WORKPLACE/RESCUER → EXPERT → EXIT

        When does Pt XI impose a duty (rescuer / secondary / workplace)?
      Rule
        Normal-fortitude foreseeability: s 72(1)
        Factors s 72(2); no sudden-shock rule
        Consequential harm follows once physical injury actionable
      Apply
        Classify pure vs consequential
        Secondary victims: s 73(1)–(2); derivative bar s 73(3)
        Rescuers (Wicks) & workplace foreseeability (Koehler)
      Authorities

        Wicks; Koehler; Gifford
      Statutes
        Wrongs Act Pt XI ss 72–75
        Wrongs Act ss 48, 51; Evidence Act s 79
  ```
tripwires:
- Confusing pure mental harm with consequential mental harm.
- Misapplying s 72(2) factors without assessing foreseeability.
- Overlooking the specific requirements for secondary victims under s 73.
- Failing to establish a recognised psychiatric illness for claims.
