# 0013-breach-wrongs-act-s48.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Assuming foreseeability alone suffices without proving 'not insignificant' risk.
2. Mischaracterising the risk, leading to flawed calculus.
3. Applying hindsight in breach assessment contrary to s 49.
4. Neglecting burden/cost or social utility in s 48(2)(c)–(d).

### Rationale
- Foreseeability must be coupled with 'not insignificant' risk for breach.
- Accurate risk definition is crucial for proper application of s 48.
- Hindsight is explicitly excluded under s 49; its use is a common error.
- All s 48(2) factors must be considered; overlooking any can lead to errors.

```mermaid
mindmap
root((Breach — s 48 + Shirt))
  A. Issue
    Define precise risk
    Reasonable precautions taken?
  B. Rule
    s 48(1): not-insignificant risk
    s 48(2): prob/seriousness/burden/social utility
    s 49: no hindsight
  C. Application
    Define risk at correct generality
    Weigh (a)–(d) factors
    Decide breach on available info
