front: "Breach (Vic): how to run Wrongs Act s 48 alongside the Shirt calculus when testing reasonable precautions?"
back: |
  Issue.
  Whether the defendant breached the Victorian negligence standard by failing to take reasonable precautions against a not-insignificant risk under Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48, applying the Shirt calculus.

  Rule.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48(1)â€“(2) sets the statutory framework for breach and requires both foreseeability of a "not insignificant" risk of harm and a balance of the s 48(2) factors:
  - probability that harm would occur if care were not taken;
  - likely seriousness of the harm;
  - burden, cost, and practicability of taking precautions; and
  - social utility of the activity that creates the risk.

  High Court authority emphasises that breach turns on what a reasonable person would do in the circumstances, not mere possibility of harm (Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40). The assessment must be time-sliced, relying on information reasonably available when the conduct occurred (Tapp v Australian Bushmen's Campdraft & Rodeo Association Ltd [2022] HCA 11). Accurate risk characterisation avoids distorting the calculus (Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330; Vairy v Wyong Shire Council (2005) 223 CLR 422). Victorian courts apply this statutory framework in practice (Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 260).

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Precisely define the risk at the correct level of generality.
  (2) Establish foreseeability and that the risk was "not insignificant" (excluding fanciful or remote risks).
  (3) Weigh the s 48(2)(a)â€“(d) factors: probability, seriousness, burden/cost, and social utility.
  (4) Link findings to specific precautions a reasonable person would have taken.
  (5) Exclude hindsight under s 49 and integrate statutory qualifiers on obvious or inherent risks (ss 53â€“55).
  (6) Conclude whether breach occurred.

  Authorities map.
  - Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40, 43â€“45.
  - Tapp v Australian Bushmen's Campdraft & Rodeo Association Ltd [2022] HCA 11, [10]â€“[20].
  - Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330, 337â€“339.
  - Vairy v Wyong Shire Council (2005) 223 CLR 422, 430â€“433.
  - Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 260, [15]â€“[25].

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48 (breach), 49 (hindsight excluded), 53 (obvious risk), 54â€“55 (no duty to warn of obvious risk; inherent risk), 56 (professionals).

  Tripwires.
  See the `tripwires` list for common breach pitfalls to avoid.

  Conclusion.
  Breach arises only if, on the information reasonably available at the time, a prudent person would have taken cost-justified precautions after weighing the s 48(2) factors, and no statutory qualifier displaces that conclusion.

why_it_matters: |
  Melbourne Law School exams reward precise statutory breach reasoning, not rote recitation of the Shirt calculus. Leading with s 48(1)â€“(2), time-slicing the risk assessment, and integrating s 49 and ss 53â€“55 demonstrate disciplined, Victoria-specific analysis and maintain clear distinction between breach, duty, and causation.

tripwires:
  - Assuming foreseeability alone suffices without proving "not insignificant" risk.
  - Mischaracterising the risk, leading to flawed calculus.
  - Applying hindsight in breach assessment contrary to s 49.
  - Neglecting burden/cost or social utility in s 48(2)(c)â€“(d).
