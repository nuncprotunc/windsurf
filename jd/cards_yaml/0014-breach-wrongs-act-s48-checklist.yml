  Breach (Vic): how to run Wrongs Act s 48 with the Shirt calculus under exam pressure?
back: |
  Issue — Did the defendant breach the Victorian standard by failing to take reasonable precautions against a not-insignificant risk under Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48?

  Rule — Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48(1)–(2) requires:
  - Foreseeability of a risk that is "not insignificant" (excluding far-fetched or fanciful risks);
  - A reasonable person would have taken precautions after weighing:
    (a) probability of harm if care not taken;
    (b) likely seriousness of harm;
    (c) burden, cost and practicality of precautions;
    (d) social utility of the activity creating the risk.

  The High Court in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 established the balancing method and forbade hindsight. The risk must be precisely characterised and assessed prospectively, time-sliced to the information reasonably available when the conduct occurred (Tapp v Australian Bushmen's Campdraft & Rodeo Association Ltd [2022] HCA 11). Risk characterisation must avoid distortion (Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330; Vairy v Wyong Shire Council (2005) 223 CLR 422). The Victorian Court of Appeal in Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 260 applies this statutory breach framework in Victoria.

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Define the specific risk at the correct level of generality.
  (2) Establish foreseeability and that the risk was "not insignificant".
  (3) Identify concrete precautions and weigh each s 48(2) factor (cost, time, practicality).
  (4) Explain why a prudent person would or would not have adopted those precautions.
  (5) Address statutory qualifiers: s 49 (exclude hindsight), ss 53–55 (obvious/inherent risk), s 56 (professionals).
  (6) Conclude on breach.

  Authorities map —
  - Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40.
  - Tapp v Australian Bushmen's Campdraft & Rodeo Association Ltd [2022] HCA 11.
  - Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330.
  - Vairy v Wyong Shire Council (2005) 223 CLR 422.
  - Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 260.

  Statutory hook —
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48, 49, 53, 54, 55, 56.

  Tripwires —
  - Treating foreseeability alone as sufficient without proving a "not insignificant" risk.
  - Misdescribing the risk (too broad or too narrow).
  - Using hindsight contrary to s 49's prospective assessment.
  - Ignoring cost/practicality or social utility under s 48(2).
  - Treating obvious risk as absolute where defendant created or heightened the danger.

  Conclusion — Breach arises only if, prospectively, a prudent person would have adopted proportionate, practical precautions when s 48(2) factors are balanced and no statutory qualifier displaces that result.

why_it_matters: |
    Melbourne Law School exams reward answers that lead with s 48(1)–(2), time-slice the Shirt calculus, and then check statutory qualifiers. This approach keeps breach analysis distinct from duty and causation and anchors conclusions to evidence, costs, and practicality.
