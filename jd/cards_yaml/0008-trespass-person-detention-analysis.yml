  Issue — In shopkeeper/police detention, which trespass torts arise (battery, assault, false imprisonment) and is restraint justified by statute or consent?

  Rule —
  - Battery is direct, voluntary physical contact without lawful justification: Williams v Milotin (1957) 97 CLR 465, 474.
  - False imprisonment is total restraint; once proved, the onus shifts to the defendant to justify it: Murray v Ministry of Defence [1988] 1 WLR 692; Myer Stores Ltd v Soo [1991] 2 VR 597, 611.
  - Assault is conduct causing reasonable apprehension of imminent unlawful contact.
  - Entry onto land usually rests on an implied licence; exceeding it vitiates authority: Halliday v Nevill (1984) 155 CLR 1, 10–11.
  - Aggravated and exemplary damages may be awarded for high-handed trespasses: Fontin v Katapodis (1962) 108 CLR 177, 183–184; New South Wales v Ibbett (2006) 229 CLR 638, 647 [28].
  - Consent and necessity remain complete defences if established.

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Classify the torts: contact (battery), apprehension (assault), total restraint (false imprisonment).
  (2) Identify the actor (shopkeeper, security, police) and their purpose.
  (3) Demand proof of statutory preconditions and proportional force.
  (4) Test entry authority and implied-licence limits.
  (5) Remedies: compensatory damages; consider aggravated and exemplary awards.

  Authorities map —
  - Williams v Milotin — Battery definition.
  - Murray v Ministry of Defence; Myer Stores v Soo — False imprisonment onus/knowledge.
  - Halliday v Nevill — Entry and implied licence.
  - Fontin v Katapodis; New South Wales v Ibbett — Aggravated/exemplary damages.

  Statutory hook —
  - Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) ss 458–459 (arrest without warrant), s 462A (force).
  - Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ss 3W, 3ZC.
  - Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) ss 10, 12, 13(a).

  Tripwires —
  - Treating partial obstruction as false imprisonment.
  - Requiring "hostility" for battery.
  - Ignoring the onus shift after restraint is shown.
  - Equating suspicion with reasonable grounds.
  - Overlooking implied-licence limits on entry.

  Conclusion — Classify the trespasses, require statutory justification, scrutinise force and entry, and if limits are exceeded award compensatory plus aggravated and exemplary damages.

why_it_matters: |
  Shopkeeper/police detention problems are MLS staples. Examiners expect you to classify each trespass, interrogate statutory authority, note the onus shifting for false imprisonment, and structure remedies (including aggravated/exemplary damages) with precise pinpoints.
