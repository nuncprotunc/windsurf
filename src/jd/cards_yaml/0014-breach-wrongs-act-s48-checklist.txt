front: "Breach (Vic): how to run Wrongs Act s 48 with the Shirt calculus under exam pressure?"
back: |
  Issue.
  Did the defendant breach the Victorian standard by failing to take reasonable precautions against a not-insignificant risk under Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48?

  Rule.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48(1)â€“(2) requires:
    - Foreseeability of a risk that is "not insignificant" (excluding far-fetched or fanciful risks);
    - A reasonable person would have taken precautions after weighing:
      (a) probability of harm if care not taken;
      (b) likely seriousness of harm;
      (c) burden, cost and practicality of precautions;
      (d) social utility of the activity creating the risk.

  The High Court in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 established the balancing method and forbade hindsight. The risk must be precisely characterised and assessed prospectively, time-sliced to the information reasonably available when the conduct occurred (Tapp v Australian Bushmen's Campdraft & Rodeo Association Ltd [2022] HCA 11). Risk characterisation must avoid distortion (Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330; Vairy v Wyong Shire Council (2005) 223 CLR 422). The Victorian Court of Appeal in Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 260 applies this statutory breach framework in Victoria.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Define the specific risk at the correct level of generality.
  (2) Establish foreseeability and that the risk was "not insignificant".
  (3) Identify concrete precautions and weigh each s 48(2) factor (cost, time, practicality).
  (4) Explain why a prudent person would or would not have adopted those precautions.
  (5) Address statutory qualifiers: s 49 (exclude hindsight), ss 53â€“55 (obvious/inherent risk), s 56 (professionals).
  (6) Conclude on breach.

  Authorities map.
    - Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40.
    - Tapp v Australian Bushmen's Campdraft & Rodeo Association Ltd [2022] HCA 11.
    - Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330.
    - Vairy v Wyong Shire Council (2005) 223 CLR 422.

  Statutory hook.
    - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48, 49, 53, 54, 55, 56.

  Tripwires.
  - Assuming foreseeability alone suffices without proving "not insignificant" risk.
  - Mischaracterising the risk at an incorrect level of generality.
  - Applying hindsight in breach analysis contrary to s 49.
  - Neglecting cost or social utility in the s 48(2) balancing exercise.

  Conclusion.
  Breach arises only if, prospectively, a prudent person would have adopted proportionate, practical precautions when s 48(2) factors are balanced and no statutory qualifier displaces that result.

why_it_matters: |
  Melbourne Law School exams reward answers that lead with s 48(1)â€“(2), time-slice the Shirt calculus, and then check statutory qualifiers. This approach keeps breach analysis distinct from duty and causation and anchors conclusions to evidence, costs, and practicality.
