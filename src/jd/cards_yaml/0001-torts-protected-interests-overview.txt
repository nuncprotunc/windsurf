  Issue.
  How does classifying the claimantâ€™s protected interest (injury, property, or pure economic loss) shape the Victorian negligence roadmap before breach, causation, and remedies?

  Rule.
    - Injury: negligence or intentional-tort scaffolds with material-risk warnings (Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479, 490â€“493) and the Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112, 121 foreseeability threshold.
    - Property: trespass protects possession and requires direct, unauthorised physical interference; nuisance turns on unreasonableness (Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 St Tr 1029; Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock (The Wagon Mound) (No 1) [1961] AC 388 (PC) 426 (persuasive)).
    - Pure economic loss: no general dutyâ€”confine liability with salient features (Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36, [118]â€“[122]; Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners SP 61288 [2014] HCA 36).

  Application scaffold.
    - Classify the interest and separate consequential loss from pure economic loss.
    - For injury, apply Wrongs Act s 48 (standard of care), s 51 (causation/scope), and any Pt XI mental-harm gates (s 74) before remedies.
    - For property, confirm possession, characterise the interference (direct trespass versus nuisance reasonableness), and select proportionate remedies.
    - For pure economic loss, run the salient-features matrixâ€”vulnerability, assumption of responsibility, reliance, indeterminacy, and coherence (Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258, [103]; Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge "Willemstad" (1976) 136 CLR 529).
    - Close with remoteness (Wagon Mound 426), statutory overlays (Pt VBA thresholds/caps, Pt XI mental harm), and any defences.
    - (Example) Consequential vs pure: profits lost due to physical factory damage = consequential; profits lost from negligent advice with no physical damage = pure economic loss. <!-- loss example added -->

  Authorities map.
    - Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479, 490â€“493 â€” injury warnings and standard of care.
    - Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112, 121 â€” foreseeability floor for injury/property.
    - Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180; Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners SP 61288 [2014] HCA 36 â€” salient features constrain economic loss duties.
    - Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 St Tr 1029 â€” possession-centred trespass liability.
    - Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock (The Wagon Mound) (No 1) [1961] AC 388 (PC) 426 (persuasive) â€” remoteness of kind.
    - Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562; Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil (2000) 205 CLR 254 â€” coherence when extending duties to omissions/public actors.

  Statutory hook.
    - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48, 51(1)(b), 51(4), s 74, Pt XI, Pt VBA (including s 28G threshold).

  Tripwires.
    - Misclassifying consequential loss as pure economic loss.
    - Ignoring Pt VBA thresholds or caps for damages.
    - Neglecting Pt XI and s 74 for mental harm.
    - Confusing possession with ownership in trespass.

  Conclusion.
  Start with the interest classification, apply the tailored doctrine plus statutory overlays, then deliver liability and remedy so the exam roadmap stays coherent.

why_it_matters: |
  Starting with the protected interest (people, property, pure economic) keeps the exam roadmap tight: you signpost s 48/s 51 early, separate consequential from pure economic loss, and avoid coherence traps under Pt XI and Pt VBA under time pressure.
