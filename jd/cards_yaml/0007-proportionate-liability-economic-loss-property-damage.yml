  Issue.
  When does Pt IVAA apportionment apply to Victorian economic loss or property damage, and how do mixed claims plus pleading timing affect engagement?
  
  Rule.
  Pt IVAA applies only to apportionable claims for economic loss or property damage arising from a failure to take reasonable care (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 24AF). Defendants must plead the defence under court rules (no statutory pleading section).
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Engagement: isolate economic/property loss caused by failure to take reasonable care (s 24AF).
  
  Authorities map.
  Engagement/mixed claims: Hunt & Hunt 247 CLR 613, 638 [27]; ABN Amro 224 FCR 1, 58 [114]; Selig 255 CLR 661, 673 [34].
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA ss 24AF–24AP (incl 24AG, 24AH, 24AJ, 24AK, 24AL, 24AM, 24AN, 24AS); Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2 ss 18, 236; Corporations Act
  
  Tripwires.
  Assuming apportionment applies automatically without pleading. Treating non-apportionable statutory claims as covered just because they are in the same proceeding. Ignoring s 24AM intentional/fraud exclusions or ACL/Corporations carve-outs.
  
  Conclusion.
  Engage Pt IVAA by isolating the apportionable loss, pleading the defence, managing concurrent wrongdoers and statutory carve-outs, and sequencing settlement, contribution and contributory negligence deliberately.
  
why_it_matters: |
  Understanding when proportionate liability kicks in (i.e. the engagement
    and mixed‑claim rules) is vital in commercial, negligence, professional liability,
    and statutory claim problems. In exams, marks are often lost by assuming Pt IVAA
    applies to non‑apportionable causes or by failing to plead apportionment under the
    court rules (there is no Pt IVAA statutory pleading). Strategic decisions (settling
    with one defendant, offers of compromise) depend on knowing s 24AK (subsequent actions)
    and s 24AJ (contribution bar). Policy tensions: protecting plaintiffs vs preventing
    unfair burden on one defendant; risk of "empty chair" defendants; procedural fairness
    vs efficiency. Examiners expect clear pinpoints (24AE–24AP map), apex authorities
    an H1 answer from merely competent.
