front: 'Consequential mental harm (Vic): is psychiatric injury too remote?'
back: 'Issue.

  Whether the plaintiff’s psychiatric injury is within the scope of liability or too
  remote when it follows another injury.

  __HD__0__

  Remoteness confines liability to reasonably foreseeable kinds of harm.

  the exact mechanism or magnitude need not be foreseen (Overseas Tankship (The Wagon
  Mound No 1) [1961] Appeal Cases (AC) 388 (Privy Council (PC)).

  Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837.

  Chapman v Hearse [1961] HCA 46.

  (1961) 106 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 112).

  __HD__1__

  1) Characterise the harm as an Recognised psychiatric injury (RPI) under s 67.

  2) Confirm it is consequential on another injury (s 67).

  3) Apply s 74(1)(a)-(b) normal‑fortitude filter (plus known susceptibility) with
  s 74(2)’s circumstances.

  __HD__2__

  Classification of harm: s 67.

  RPI requirement: ss 67, 74.

  Statutory filter: s 74(1)-(2).

  __HD__3__

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 67, 74 (context: ss 72-73 for pure mental harm).

  __HD__4__

  Treating grief/worry as RPI.

  Ignoring s 74(2)’s inclusion of the initial injury as part of the circumstances.

  Importing s 72-73 pure mental harm controls into consequential claims.

  __HD__5__

  Consequential psychiatric injury is recoverable when an RPI of that kind was reasonably
  foreseeable within s 74’s framework.

  mere distress without RPI fails.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  Lead: Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 35;
  (2002) 211 CLR 317.

  __HD__3__

  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.

  __HD__4__

  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps

  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

  __HD__5__

  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: "MLS scope questions turn on whether you run remoteness or the statutory\n\
  \  mental-harm screen first. Start by classifying the claim: consequential (s 74)\
  \ versus\n  pure (ss 72–73). Cite s 67 to confirm the harm is a recognised psychiatric\
  \ illness.\n  Then apply the normal-fortitude filter and the “circumstances” extension\
  \ in s 74(2)\n  before finishing with remoteness (kind, not extent). Tame/Annetts\
  \ and Jaensch help\n  dislodge old UK “shock” control mechanisms, while Pusey supports\
  \ thin-skull reasoning\n  once the kind is foreseeable. Answers that collapse distress\
  \ with RPI or demand\n  precise mechanism predictions lose marks; sequencing statutory\
  \ elements with foreseeable-kind\n  analysis earns H1 credit.\n\n  \n"
mnemonic: "KIND–RPI–FORTITUDE: Kind foreseeable? → Recognised psychiatric illness\n\
  \  (s 67) → Normal fortitude / known susceptibility (s 74) → Remoteness respects\
  \ thin\n  skull.\n"

tripwires:
- Treating grief or worry as sufficient without a recognised psychiatric illness.
- Forgetting s 74(2) folds the initial injury into the foreseeability circumstances.
- Applying pure mental harm controls (ss 72–73) to consequential claims.
- Demanding foreseeability of precise mechanism rather than the kind of harm.
- Misusing thin skull to dodge the kind-of-harm inquiry.
