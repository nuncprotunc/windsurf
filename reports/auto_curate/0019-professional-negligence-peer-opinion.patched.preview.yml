front: "In a professional negligence problem, how do you apply Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic)"
back: |
  Issue.
  Does the defendant meet the Division 5 professional standard or have a valid s 59 defence?
  Rule.
  Section 57 defines a "professional" and "professional service".
  anyone holding out a particular skill owes the care reasonably expected of a practitioner of that skill at the time (s 58).
  Application scaffold.
  1) Identify the professional and professional service under s 57.
  2) Classify the allegation: warnings (apply Rogers/Wallace.
  s 60 bars s 59) versus diagnosis/treatment/practice.
  Authorities map.
  Duty/warnings: Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 479, 490-493.
  Wallace v Kam (2013) 250 CLR 375, [34]-[40].
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 57-60.
  Tripwires.
  Applying s 59 to warnings/information (barred by s 60).
  Treating expert evidence as sufficient without proving national, time‑specific acceptance.
  Assuming unanimity or local custom is required (s 59(3) allows multiple opinions).
  Conclusion.
  Exam tip: sequence issues -> rules -> application -> conclusion; cite a lead authority and the operative section.
  __HD__0__
  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.
  __HD__1__
  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.
  __HD__2__
  Lead: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562.
  __HD__3__
  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.
  __HD__4__
  
  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps
  
  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss
  
  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.
  __HD__5__
  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems demand disciplined sequencing: define the professional
   field (s 57), separate warnings (s 60) from practice (s 59), and make the defendant
   prove each statutory element, including national scope and timing. High‑band answers
   show the court’s supervisory role (Naxakis), deploy Tanah Merah to test reasonableness,
   and integrate Rogers/Wallace for warnings. Scripts that treat expert evidence or
   local custom as dispositive, forget the burden, or ignore s 59(3)’s allowance for
   competing opinions lose marks.

mnemonic: PRO-WIDE-TIME: PROfessional? (s 57) → Warnings out (s 60) → Identify Defence
 (s 59) with WIDely accepted In Australia, significant practitioners, During the
 relevant TIME, and court review.
