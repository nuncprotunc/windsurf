  Breach — Wrongs Act s 48 checklist: how do you triage foreseeability, precautions,
    and statutory overlays under exam pressure?

  Issue.
  How should you triage Wrongs Act s 48 breach analysis under exam pressure so that foreseeability, precautions, and statutory overlays are covered systematically?
  
  Rule.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 requires: (i) a foreseeable risk known or ought to have been known; (ii) the risk must be “not insignificant”; (iii) a reasonable person would have taken precautions; (iv) s 48(2) factors (probability, seriousness, burden, social utility) must be weighed contextually (Wyong v
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Frame the risk precisely at the relevant ex ante time-slice (Tapp v ABCRA [2022] HCA 11 at [127]–[129], [150]–[156]). 2) Apply s 48(1): confirm foreseeability and “not insignificant” status (exclude far-fetched/fanciful).
  
  Authorities map.
  Core framework: Wyong v Shirt; Wrongs Act s 48. Risk/time-slice discipline: Tapp [2022] HCA 11. Public authority/recreation: Vairy (2005) 223 CLR 422; Romeo (1998) 192 CLR 431; Cole (2004) 217 CLR 469.
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48–56; ACL (Cth) s 60; CCA 2010 (Cth) s 139A.
  
  Tripwires.
  Treating foreseeability as breach without proving “not insignificant”. Reframing the risk with hindsight instead of ex ante evidence. Treating “obvious risk” as absolute when D heightened the danger.
  
  Conclusion.
  A disciplined s 48 checklist demands precise risk characterisation, contextual balancing of the s 48(2) factors, and explicit handling of statutory overlays; only then can you justify whether additional precautions were required or reasonable
  
why_it_matters: |
  MLS scripts lose marks when they cite Shirt but ignore Victorian
    statutory rails. This checklist forces you to apply s 48(1)–(2) methodically, integrate
    public authority and recreational authorities, and separate breach from causation
    while acknowledging ACL/CCA overlays—hallmarks of an H1 answer under pressure.
