  Issue — When does Pt IVAA (proportionate liability) apply to apportion economic loss or property damage in Victoria, and how do mixed claims and pleading/timing affect engagement?

  Rule —
  - Pt IVAA applies only to an "apportionable claim" for economic loss or property damage arising from a failure to take reasonable care: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 24AF.
  - The defendant must plead proportionate liability under the court rules; it does not operate automatically.
  - Mixed claims require isolating the apportionable claim and its divisible loss before apportioning.

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Identify the pleaded losses.
  (2) Characterise each cause (negligence versus statutory).
  (3) Ask whether the same damage is caused by multiple concurrent wrongdoers.
  (4) If yes, plead proportionate liability and identify putative wrongdoers.
  (5) Address exclusions and settlement sequencing.

  Authorities map —
  - Hunt & Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees Pty Ltd (2013) 247 CLR 613, 638 [27] — Defines "one damage" and scope of failure to take reasonable care.
  - ABN Amro Bank NV v Bathurst Regional Council (2014) 224 FCR 1, 58 [114] — Isolates apportionable loss; importance of pleadings.
  - Selig v Wealthsure Pty Ltd (2015) 255 CLR 661, 673 [34] — Non-apportionable statutory claims are not swept in by joinder.
  - St George Bank Ltd v Quinerts Pty Ltd [2009] VSCA 245 — Victorian authority on Pt IVAA engagement.

  Statutory hook —
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA ss 24AF–24AP (especially ss 24AG, 24AH, 24AI, 24AJ, 24AK, 24AM).
  - ACL ss 18, 236 and Corporations Act ss 1041H–1041I may travel alongside but are not automatically apportionable under Pt IVAA.

  Tripwires —
  - Assuming apportionment applies automatically without pleading.
  - Treating non-apportionable statutory claims as covered simply because they are joined.
  - Misstating settlement consequences (remember s 24AK governs subsequent actions).
  - Ignoring s 24AM intentional/fraud exclusions or ACL/Corporations carve-outs.
  - Folding contributory negligence into apportionment instead of dealing with it afterward.
  Conclusion — Engage Pt IVAA only where the pleaded loss is economic/property loss from a failure to take reasonable care, the defence is pleaded, concurrent wrongdoers are identified, and exclusions/settlement consequences are managed.

why_it_matters: |
  Knowing precisely when Pt IVAA engages—and when it does not—drives pleading strategy, settlement sequencing, and exam outcomes. Marks are often lost by treating ACL/Corporations claims as apportionable merely because they sit beside negligence, or by forgetting to plead proportionate liability at all. Correctly isolating the "same damage," naming concurrent wrongdoers, and mapping s 24AJ–24AK effects avoids empty-chair traps and preserves contribution and subsequent action rights.
