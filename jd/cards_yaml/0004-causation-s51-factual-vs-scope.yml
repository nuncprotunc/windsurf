front: 'Causation (Vic): how do you run factual causation and scope under ss 51–52?'
back: 'Issue. Has D’s negligence factually caused P’s harm and should liability extend
  to that harm under the Wrongs Act without collapsing factual causation into scope
  of liability? Rule. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(1)(a) keeps factual causation as
  a “necessary condition” test and excludes self-serving hypotheticals unless against
  interest (s 51(3)–(4)). Apply Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(2) only where established
  principles justify departure, using March v Stramare (1991) 171 CLR 506 for commonsense
  causation. Scope under s 52 turns on whether the harm falls within the risk pursued
  in Wallace v Kam (2013) 250 CLR 375, with P carrying the onus (s 52(1)(b)). Proof
  stays on the balance under Evidence Act s 140. Application scaffold. 1) Factual
  causation — deploy but-for, build circumstantial inference (Strong v Woolworths
  (2012) 246 CLR 182, [5]–[9]), reject mere possibilities (Amaca v Booth (2011) 246
  CLR 36, [49]). 2) Exceptional cases — invoke s 51(2) only where established principles
  justify it; Adeels Palace (2009) 239 CLR 420, [52]–[57] confines policy departures.
  3) Scope — apply s 52 with Wallace v Kam framing to interveners, using Mahony (1985)
  156 CLR 522, 529–530, Haber [1963] VR 339, 348–350, Yates (1990) 24 NSWLR 317. 4)
  Finish with defendant-by-defendant conclusions before apportionment or defences.
  Authorities map. But-for and inference: Strong 246 CLR 182, [5]–[9]; Amaca 246 CLR
  36, [49]; March 171 CLR 506. Exceptional restraint: Adeels 239 CLR 420, [52]–[57].

  hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 51–52 (with s 51(2), s 52(1)(b)); Evidence Act 1995
  (Cth) / 2008 (Vic) s 140. Tripwires. Treating s 51(2) as a generic “material increase
  in risk” escape hatch. Collapsing factual causation and scope. Assuming third-party
  crime stays within scope without proving but-for. Treating routine medical negligence
  as breaking the chain contrary to Mahony. Conclusion. Prove factual causation under
  s 51(1)(a) (resisting s 51(2) shortcuts), then decide scope under s 52 with authority-driven
  analysis before turning to apportionment or defences.

why_it_matters: 'Examiners penalise conflation. Sequencing s 51(1)(a) but-for → s
  51(2) exceptional → s 52 scope lets you deploy the right authority at each node.
  Strong/Amaca show how to build or resist inference; Adeels limits shortcuts; Wallace
  frames the normative limb; Mahony and Haber keep you honest on medical negligence
  and suicide.
