front: "How do you apply the Shirt calculus to determine breach in negligence?"
back: |
  Issue — Identify when a defendant falls below the reasonable-response standard under Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 once duty is already established.

  Rule —
  - The Shirt calculus asks whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions by weighing: 
    (1) foreseeability (not far‑fetched or fanciful) (Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112, 121, s 48(1)(a));
    (2) not insignificant risk (s 48(1)(b));
    (3) probability and seriousness of harm;
    (4) burden of precautions; and
    (5) social utility of the activity.
  - Risk must be characterised ex ante without hindsight: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 49.
  - Careful risk definition is essential: Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330, 345–46 [44].

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Frame the specific risk without hindsight (s 49).
  (2) Establish foreseeability and "not insignificant" risk (s 48(1)(a)-(b)).
  (3) Evaluate s 48(2)(a)-(d): probability, seriousness, burden, social utility.
  (4) Cite fact anchors (public authority, recreation, vulnerable plaintiff).
  (5) Keep causation and contributory negligence separate (s 51).

  Authorities map —
  - Wyong v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40, 47-48 — Threshold and balancing.
  - Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112, 121 — Foreseeability standard.
  - Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; (2005) 223 CLR 422 — Anti-hindsight.
  - Brodie v Singleton Shire Council (2001) 206 CLR 512 — Public authorities.
  - Strong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5; (2012) 246 CLR 182 — Modern application.

  Statutory hook —
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48-49, 51 — Breach and causation framework.
  - Consider Pt IVAA for proportionate liability where applicable.

  Tripwires —
  - Treating foreseeability alone as breach without proving "not insignificant" (s 48(1)).
  - Framing the risk with hindsight rather than ex ante (s 49 guardrail).
  - Reducing s 48(2) to a checklist instead of a balancing exercise.
  - Over‑relying on "obvious risk" where D's operations created the hazard.
  - Collapsing breach with causation instead of applying s 51 separately.

  Conclusion — Breach is established only if the s 48 balance shows a reasonable person would have taken additional precautions. Keep causation and contributory negligence in their own steps.

why_it_matters: |
  This is the core Victorian breach scaffold. Starting at s 48(1) forces precise risk identification and a "not insignificant" screen; s 48(2) then structures a proportional response to probability, seriousness, burden, and social utility, with s 49’s anti-hindsight guardrail and s 51 separating causation.
