front: "Causation (Vic): how do ss 51–52 handle factual causation, exceptional cases, and scope when interveners appear?"
back: |
  Issue — Has D's negligence factually caused P's harm, and should liability extend to that harm under Wrongs Act ss 51-52 when intervening acts arise?

  Rule —
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(1)(a) demands a "necessary condition" (but-for) link.
  - Section 51(2) permits departure only in exceptional cases and consistently with established principles.
  - Section 52 requires the court to decide whether responsibility should extend, weighing justice and policy, with the onus on P.

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Run but-for test: deploy circumstantial inference where needed (Strong v Woolworths (2012) 246 CLR 182 at [5]-[9]).
  (2) Exclude bare possibility (Amaca v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36 at [49]).
  (3) Remember loss-of-chance limits (Tabet v Gett (2010) 240 CLR 537 at [111]-[112]).
  (4) For exceptional cases under s 51(2), require clear proof of established principles.
  (5) Under s 52, weigh policy factors for scope, especially with interveners.

why_it_matters: |
  Exams punish conflating causation limbs. Sequencing ss 51–52 lets you cite the right authorities, rebut 'material risk' shortcuts, and analyse interveners with Wallace's normative lens—hallmarks of H1 reasoning.

tripwires:
  - "Treating s 51(2) as a material-risk shortcut."
  - "Collapsing factual causation with scope contrary to Wallace."
  - "Assuming third-party crime satisfies causation absent but-for proof."
  - "Letting routine medical negligence break the chain contra Mahony."
  - "Declaring suicide wholly voluntary despite impaired volition."
  - "Ignoring P’s onus and Evidence Act s 140 calibration."
