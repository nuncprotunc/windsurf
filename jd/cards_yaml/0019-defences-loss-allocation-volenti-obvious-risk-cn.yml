  Issue. When will consent or “obvious/inherent risk” defeat liability, and how are damages reduced for contributory negligence (CN) in Victoria?

  Rule. Volenti requires free and voluntary acceptance of the legal risk, not mere knowledge (rare): Scanlon v American Cigarette (No 3) [1987] VR 289; cf sports: Rootes v Shelton (1967) 116 CLR 383. Statutory overlays: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 53–56 (s 54 rebuttable presumption of awareness; s 56 onus; see also s 50 duty to warn — reasonable care) and Div 7 ss 62–63 (CN incl. claim-defeating 100%). Apportionment principles: compare culpability and causal potency: Pennington v Norris (1956) 96 CLR 10, 16; Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALJR 492, 494; 59 ALR 529, 532. Employee CN caution: Bankstown Foundry v Braistina (1986) 160 CLR 301, 310. Intoxication context: Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; 214 CLR 552; and limits on protective duties: Cole v South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club Ltd (2004) 217 CLR 469, [6].

  Application. First, identify if the risk was obvious (s 53) or inherent (s 55). If inherent (s 55: cannot be avoided by reasonable care) and it materialised, negligence is barred, but s 55(3) preserves warning duties where reasonable care under s 50 demands it (and s 56 puts the onus on the plaintiff where “failure to warn” is alleged). Volenti still demands proof of actual acceptance of the risk’s legal consequences (rare; narrow in sport). If liability remains, assess CN (s 62 standard): articulate plaintiff’s departures (fact-specific), then apportion (s 26) by culpability vs causal potency with comparative reasons anchored in evidence and context (employment pressures may temper CN). In intoxication cases, weigh s 14G and Joslyn factors.

  Conclusion. If s 55 applies or genuine volenti is made out, claim fails. Otherwise, reduce damages “just and equitable” (s 26), including up to 100% under s 63 where warranted.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS exams reward sequencing and coherence. Start with duty/breach causation already resolved, then run defences in order: (1) s 55 inherent risk (complete bar if truly unavoidable by reasonable care), (2) volenti (rare—demand evidence of informed acceptance of the legal risk; don’t equate with mere participation), (3) s 56 onus where failure-to-warn alleged, (4) CN under s 26, applying the Pennington/Podrebersek matrix (culpability vs causal potency) with specific factual anchors, (5) consider s 62–63 (including claim-defeating CN) and s 14G (intoxication/illegality). Add a Commonwealth overlay where waivers for recreational services are pleaded (CCA/ACL), and preserve coherence between tort, statute and contract. Policy tensions: personal responsibility vs protective obligations (Cole); floodgates vs fairness in apportionment; statutory certainty vs common-law nuance. High-band answers write short, reasoned apportionment paragraphs (numbers + reasons) and explicitly address why volenti is not made out in most scenarios.
mnemonic: "BAR–VOL–ONUS–CN–%: Bar (s55) → Volenti → Onus (s56) → Contrib Neg (s26/62) → % incl. up to 100% (s63)"

tripwires:
  - Treating “obvious risk” as an automatic no-duty rule in Victoria.
  - Equating mere knowledge/participation with volenti.
  - Presumption of awareness under s 54 ≠ proof of acceptance of legal risk (volenti still requires acceptance).
  - Skipping s 56 onus when alleging failure to warn.
  - Forgetting s 14G in intoxication/illegality scenarios.
  - Apportioning CN without reasons tied to culpability and causal potency.
  - Ignoring employment context tempering CN (pressure/inattention).
  - Citing Wynbergen without noting s 63 reform in Victoria.
