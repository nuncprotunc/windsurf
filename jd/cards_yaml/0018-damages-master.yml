  Issue.
  Has the plaintiff established eligibility for non-economic loss and ancillary heads of damage under the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), and how should aggravated and exemplary damages be characterised and limited?
  
  Rule.
  Part VBA requires a "significant injury" certificate unless an exception applies. Sections 28LB–28LK prescribe the process; s 28LF defines thresholds (generally >5% WPI for physical injury, extra criteria for psychiatric impairment via s 28LJ).
  
  Application scaffold.
  
  Authorities map.
  
  Statutory hook.
  
  Tripwires.
  
  Conclusion.
  Damages depend first on breaching the Pt VBA gateway, then on meticulous application of statutory caps and proper distinction between compensatory (aggravated) and punitive (exemplary) remedies, mindful of Gray''s restraint.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS damages questions reward disciplined sequencing. Begin with the
    Pt VBA gate: cite s 28LC(2)(a) to see if intentional or sexual misconduct bypasses
    the certificate, otherwise run the s 28LF/LJ metrics. Only after eligibility do
    you price the claim—loss of earnings cap (s 28F(2)) and the indexed non-economic
    ceiling (s 28G/s 28H). Answers that recite stale dollar figures lose marks; flag
    that caps are indexed annually. Distinguish aggravated (compensatory) from exemplary
    (punitive) using Uren, Lamb and Gray, and note Ibbett to show punitive awards still
    bite against the State. Mention Fontin to avoid conflating provocation with mitigation
    of compensatory damages. This scaffold helps you survive time pressure and signals
    policy awareness around insurance affordability versus claimant vindication.

  THRESH→CAP→CHAR→POLICY: Threshold (s 28LC/28LF) → Caps (s 28F; s 28G/H)
    → Characterise (Aggravated vs Exemplary; Gray) → Policy (insurance vs deterrance).
