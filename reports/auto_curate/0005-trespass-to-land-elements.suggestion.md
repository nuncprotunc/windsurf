# 0005-trespass-to-land-elements.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Treating trespass as ownership protection (it protects possession).
2. Confusing trespass (direct) with nuisance (indirect/unreasonableness).
3. Assuming mistake or good faith defeats liability.
4. Forgetting actionable per se (no proof of damage needed).

### Rationale
- Common error in understanding the nature of trespass.
- Students often conflate direct and indirect torts.
- Misunderstanding of the role of mistake in liability.
- Failure to recognize that trespass does not require proof of damage.
