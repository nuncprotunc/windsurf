  Issue.
  Which factors determine unreasonable interference in private nuisance, and how do Victorian statutes affect the balance?

  Rule.
  - Unreasonableness is assessed by ordinary sensitivity (not the unusually delicate), locality, duration/frequency, gravity/type of harm, malice, and the utility of the conduct; physical damage strongly weighs against the defendant.
  - The test is objective and contextual.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Confirm proprietary standing and the interference (noise/odour/vibration/damage).
  (2) Work factor-by-factor (sensitivity, locality, duration/frequency, gravity, utility, malice) with evidence.
  (3) Consider statutory authority/defences and select remedy (damages v calibrated injunction).

  Authorities map.
  - Hargrave v Goldman (HCA) — Links reasonableness to responsibility for hazards.
  - Burnie Port Authority v General Jones (HCA) — Integrates abnormal danger/utility into a reasonableness frame.
  - Munro v Southern Dairies (VSC) — Shows persistence/duration tipping liability.
  - Sturges v Bridgman (UK CA) — Anchors locality.
  - ACQ Pty Ltd v Cook (QCA) — Illustrates planning context in the balance.

  Statutory hook.
  - Environment Protection Act 2017 (Vic) s 25 (general environmental duty).
  - Planning and Environment Act 1987 (Vic) permits as context.
  - Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic) injunction power.
  - Compliance informs reasonableness but is not a defence without express authority.

  Tripwires.
  Refer to the dedicated `tripwires` list for recurring pitfalls in execution.

  Conclusion.
  Weigh the factors, account for any statutory authorisation, and tailor the remedy to proportionality and locality.
why_it_matters: |
  Articulating the multi-factor balance, tied to EP Act duties, planning context and calibrated remedies, is decisive on MLS nuisance fact patterns; Anchoring with Hargrave, Burnie, Munro and a limited UK reference shows doctrinal control.

tripwires:
- Conflating private nuisance with trespass.
- Assuming public utility is a defence.
- Treating extraordinary sensitivity as actionable.
- Seeking blanket injunctions without proportional tailoring.
