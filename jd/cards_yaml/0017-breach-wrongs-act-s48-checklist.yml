  Application. (1) Frame the risk precisely and at the correct time-slice using the
  information available ex ante (Tapp v Australian Bushmen’s Campdraft & Rodeo Assn
  Ltd [2022] HCA 11; (2022) 396 ALR 1 at [127]–[129], [150]–[156]). (2) Apply the
  s 48(1) threshold, then balance s 48(2)(a)–(d) with attention to public authority
  or venue realities (Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; (2005) 223 CLR 422
  at 431 [3]–[9] (Gleeson CJ & Kirby J); 451 [40]–[42] (McHugh J); Romeo v Conservation
  Commission (NT) [1998] HCA 5; (1998) 192 CLR 431 at 487–488 [152] (Hayne J); Cole
  v South Tweed Heads RLFC [2004] HCA 29; (2004) 217 CLR 469 at 473 [1]–[5] (Gleeson
  CJ); 516 [98]–[100] (Kirby J)). (3) Consider warnings (s 50), reasonableness of
  signage, and obvious/inherent risk & volenti (ss 53–56). (4) Keep breach and causation
  distinct—test factual causation and scope of liability under s 51, with the burden
  on P per s 52; leverage Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd
  v Bou Najem [2009] HCA 48; (2009) 239 CLR 420 at 435 [43] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne,
  Heydon & Crennan JJ). (5) Flag overlays such as ACL (Cth) sch 2 s 60 and CCA s 139A
  (recreational waivers limited to injury/death). (6) Conclude on whether the reasonable
  response included taking specified precautions or, if justified, reasonably doing
  nothing.

why_it_matters: 'MLS scripts lose marks when they cite Shirt yet ignore the statutory
  rails that govern Victorian breach. Starting at s 48(1) forces precise risk identification
  and the “not insignificant” screen; s 48(2) then structures a proportional response
  to probability, seriousness, burden, and social utility. Sections 49–56 keep you
  honest on hindsight, warnings, and obvious risk, while ss 51–52 insist on separate
  causation analysis. By layering in recreational/public-authority authorities (Tapp;
  Vairy; Romeo; Cole; Adeels) and the Commonwealth overlays (ACL s 60; CCA s 139A),
  you show markers you can balance safety, autonomy, and resource allocation in statute-aligned
  terms—an H1 hallmark.

tripwires:
- Treating foreseeability as sufficient without proving “not insignificant” and s
  48(3)(a)’s
- Mischaracterising the risk post-outcome instead of ex ante (Tapp; Dederer)
- Using hindsight logic contrary to s 49
- Over-relying on “obvious risk” where D’s operations heightened the danger
- Ignoring burden/social utility in public authority or venue contexts
- Blurring breach with causation instead of applying ss 51–52
- Misreading CCA s 139A (waivers confined to injury/death) or omitting ACL s 60 overlays
