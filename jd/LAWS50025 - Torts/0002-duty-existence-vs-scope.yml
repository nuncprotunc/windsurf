front: How do courts distinguish the existence of a duty of care from its scope, and
  how should you apply that distinction in a Victorian negligence problem?

  Issue. Separate duty existence from scope so Victorian negligence stays sequenced before breach or causation.

  Rule. Existence turns on foreseeability filtered by salient features and coherence (Sullivan v Moody; Perre; Woolcock). Graham Barclay Oysters ties public authorities to statutory purpose, while Crimmins, Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra, and Tame/Annetts show omissions or psychiatric harm demand control or assumed responsibility. Once existence is satisfied, Modbury Triangle confines scope to the risk that materialised and its setting.

  Application scaffold. 1) Existence: map foreseeability, salient features, and coherence before naming duty. 2) If satisfied, define scope by isolating the risk, actors, and setting. 3) Analyse breach via Wrongs Act s 48, then causation/scope under s 51 with interveners. 4) Close with remedies/defences: CN (s 26), volenti (s 54), Pt VBA caps, Pt IVAA proportionate liability, plus ACL s 18 overlay.


  Authorities map. Existence: Sullivan 207 CLR 562, 576 [50]; Perre 198 CLR 180, 225 [118]; Woolcock 216 CLR 515, 529 [23]; Brookfield 254 CLR 185, 202 [46]. Omissions/psychiatric: Crimmins 200 CLR 1; Stuart 237 CLR 215; Tame/Annetts 211 CLR 317. Public authorities: Graham Barclay Oysters 211 CLR 540, 579 [79]. Scope: Modbury 205 CLR 254, 269 [35].

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 48, 51, 54; Pt VBA caps/thresholds; Pt IVAA proportionate liability; consider ACL s 18 for concurrent statutory claims.

  Tripwires. Avoid importing the Shirt calculus into existence, collapsing scope into s 51, or skipping coherence checks; keep psychiatric-harm and omission gates tight.

  Conclusion. Sequence existence → scope → breach → causation → remedy to show doctrinal discipline and statutory literacy.
why_it_matters: |
  Examiners reward sequenced answers: existence before scope, then breach (s 48), then causation (s 51). This avoids conflation and shows statutory literacy (Pt VBA caps; CN; volenti). Referencing Sullivan, Perre/Woolcock, Modbury and public-authority coherence earns marks for policy discipline and accuracy.

tripwires:
  - Conflating existence with scope instead of treating sequentially.
  - Importing the Shirt breach calculus into the duty inquiry.
  - Ignoring omissions or psychiatric-harm limits when framing existence.
  - Failing to anchor statutory defences (s 54) or damages caps (Pt VBA) once duty is found.
  - Overlooking statutory purpose/coherence for public authorities.
