front: "What are the elements of trespass to land at common law?"
back: |
  Issue — Identify the elements of trespass to land and note limited Victorian statutory overlays.

  Rule —
  - Trespass is actionable per se.
  - Elements: (1) direct interference with land in the plaintiff's possession; (2) a voluntary act (no intention to trespass required); (3) absence of lawful justification (consent/licence, necessity, statutory authority).
  - Mistake is not a defence.

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Prove possession (actual or constructive).
  (2) Pinpoint direct entry, remaining after consent is withdrawn, or causing a physical intrusion.
  (3) Confirm voluntariness.
  (4) Test justifications: implied licence limits, necessity, and any statutory police powers.

  Authorities map —
  - Kuru v State of NSW (2008) 236 CLR 1, 19 [43] — Consent withdrawn equals trespass.
  - Halliday v Nevill (1984) 155 CLR 1, 7–8 — Implied licence narrow, revocable.
  - Plenty v Dillon (1991) 171 CLR 635, 647 — Police mistake no defence.
  - Lincoln Hunt Australia Pty Ltd v Willesee (1986) 4 NSWLR 457 — Media entry beyond licence.
  - Southwark LBC v Williams [1971] Ch 734 — Necessity strictly confined (UK persuasive).

  Statutory hook —
  - Summary Offences Act 1966 (Vic) s 9(1)(d) — Wilful trespass offence.
  - Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) ss 459, 462A — Police entry/force powers; civil tort persists.

  Tripwires —
  - Confusing trespass (direct) with nuisance (indirect).
  - Forgetting it is actionable per se (no proof of damage).
  - Treating implied licence as general or irrevocable.
  - Assuming mistake or good faith defeats liability.
  - Not proving possession (title is unnecessary).

  Conclusion — If possession, direct interference, voluntariness, and no justification are shown, trespass is made out; address defences and tailor remedies (injunction, nominal/compensatory damages, mesne profits, continuing trespass).

why_it_matters: |
  Trespass recurs in MLS exams. Markers expect quick separation of possession, directness, voluntariness and justification, then concise treatment of defences and remedies. Using Kuru, Halliday and Plenty, with a State CA and a careful UK nuance, shows doctrinal control.
