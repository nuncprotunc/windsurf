  Issue.
  When should a Victorian court recognise a private-law duty of care owed by a public authority to the plaintiff?

  Rule.
  Foreseeability is necessary but not sufficient. Duty turns on salient features constrained by institutional and statutory coherence; the policy/operational distinction is a filter, not an immunity. Central indicators include the authority’s control, knowledge, assumption/responsibility, reliance/vulnerability, and risks of indeterminate liability. Key authorities: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562, 579–580 [49]–[53]; Pyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330, [347]–[349], [355]–[357].

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Run the statutory coherence gate: identify the empowering scheme, its purpose/limits, and any preconditions.
  (2) Characterise the impugned act/omission (policy vs operational) and any specific undertaking or control.
  (3) Evaluate salient features: control, vulnerability/reliance, knowledge, indeterminacy, autonomy, and third-party agency.
  (4) Check consistency with remedial/rights frameworks and resource allocation provisions.
  (5) Supporting authorities: Hunter and New England Local Health District v McKenna (2014) 253 CLR 270, 279–284 [17]–[40]; Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra (2009) 237 CLR 215, 230–236 [43]–[81]; Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258, [103].

  Authorities map.
  - Sullivan v Moody — Coherence limits on duty recognition.
  - Pyrenees Shire Council v Day — Fire inspection duties; policy/operational calibration.
  - Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra — Control/statutory preconditions.
  - Hunter v McKenna — Statutory coherence and resource constraints.
  - Stavar — Salient-features synthesis.

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 (general negligence); ss 83–85 (public-authority principles, resource and responsibility filters).
  - Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) ss 7, 21, 38 — coherence check, not a direct cause of action.

  Tripwires.
  Refer to the dedicated `tripwires` list below for recurring pitfalls when arguing public authority duties.

  Conclusion.
  No standing duty exists; recognition is most likely where the authority undertook or controlled a specific operational function, knew of a discrete risk to a vulnerable plaintiff who reasonably relied, and recognition aligns with the statute and rights framework.

  MLS problems often involve councils, police, or health services. This card supplies an IRAC gateway focused on statutory coherence, policy/operational character, and salient features, avoiding common errors (assuming a rescue duty; merits-review drift; ignoring resource limits and Charter coherence). The cited pinpoints enable fast, authoritative duty analysis under exam pressure.

  POLAR-CC → Policy vs Operational → Legal coherence → Assumption/Responsibility → Reliance/Vulnerability → Control → Charter & causation

        When will a court recognise a negligence duty?
      Rule
        Foreseeability necessary, not sufficient
        Salient features + coherence (no blanket immunity)
        Policy/operational = filter, not defence
      Apply
        Read empowering statute; purpose/limits
        Control/assumption • reliance/vulnerability • indeterminacy
        Charter/resource coherence; avoid merits-review
      Authorities
        Sullivan v Moody; Pyrenees
        Kirkland-Veenstra; McKenna
      Statutes
        Wrongs Act ss 83–85; s 48
        Charter ss 7, 21, 38 (coherence)
  ```
tripwires:
- Treating policy/operational as automatic immunity.
- Assuming a general governmental rescue duty to prevent third-party harm.
- Ignoring statutory purpose or resource limits when framing duty.
- Skipping Charter coherence before extending duty.
