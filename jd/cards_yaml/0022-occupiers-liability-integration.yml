back: 'Issue. What frame governs premises injury in Victoria: occupiers’ liability
  (Pt IIA), ordinary negligence, or trespass? Note: Original front overflow preserved
  — “Victorian premises injury: when do you frame the claim as occupiers’ liability
  under Pt IIA of the Wrongs Act vs ordinary negligence or trespass, and how do you
  run the integrated duty–breach–causation analysis (including trespassers)?” Rule.
  Part IIA abolishes entrant categories and imposes a statutory duty: take reasonable
  care so entrants are not injured by the state of the premises or things done/omitted
  in relation to that state (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 14B(3)); otherwise common law
  continues (s 14B(2)). The HCA confirms ordinary negligence principles govern (Australian
  Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna (1987) 162 CLR 479, 488; [1987] HCA 7). Duties
  extend to delivery contractors and activity hazards (Thompson v Woolworths (Q’land)
  Pty Ltd (2005) 221 CLR 234, [23]–[27]; [2005] HCA 19). Trespassers may still be
  owed a duty where harm is reasonably foreseeable (Hackshaw v Shaw (1984) 155 CLR
  614, 654 (Deane J); [1984] HCA 84). Application scaffold. 1) Classify hazard: “state/things
  done” → apply s 14B(3). 2) Breach: run s 48 (foreseeable, not insignificant, reasonable
  precautions), with obvious/inherent risk and volenti overlays (ss 53–56). 3) Causation:
  apply s 51 (factual/scope); in slip cases infer but‑for where inspection systems
  were absent (Strong v Woolworths (2012) 246 CLR 182, [32]–[34]; [2012] HCA 5). 4)
  Intentional force by staff → trespass to the person and vicarious liability, not
  premises condition; trespass to land may supplement remedies. Authorities map. Duty

  provisions in breach. Assuming causation without inspection evidence (Strong). Denying

  defects instead of trespass/vicarious liability.'
why_it_matters: 'MLS problems mix premises hazards, activity risks and trespassers.
  High‑band answers: (i) source the duty in Pt IIA, (ii) use Pt X for breach/causation,
  (iii) avoid pre‑Zaluzna categories, (iv) use Thompson for activity hazards, (v)
  use Strong to prove causation, and (vi) pivot to trespass when force, not premises,
  causes the injury. This sequencing respects statutory integration and saves marks.
