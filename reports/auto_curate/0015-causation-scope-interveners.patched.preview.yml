front: "Causation (Vic): how do ss 51–52 handle factual causation, exceptional cases, and scope when interveners appear?"

  Issue.
  Has D's negligence factually caused P's harm, and should liability extend to that harm under Wrongs Act ss 51–52 when interveners arise?

  Rule.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(a) requires a "necessary condition" (but-for) link.
  - Section 51(2) allows departures only in exceptional cases consistent with established principles.
  - Section 52 tasks the court with deciding whether responsibility should extend, weighing justice and policy, with the onus on P.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Run but-for test, using circumstantial inference where needed (`Strong v Woolworths (2012) 246 CLR 182` at [5]-[9]).
  (2) Exclude bare possibility (`Amaca v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36` at [49]).
  (3) Remember loss-of-chance limits (`Tabet v Gett (2010) 240 CLR 537` at [111]-[112]).
  (4) For exceptional cases under s 51, require clear proof of established principles.
  (5) Under s 52, weigh policy factors for scope, especially with interveners.

  - `Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem (2009) 239 CLR 420` (HCA)

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 51–52 (consider s 51(2) exceptional cases discipline).

  Conclusion.
  Separate factual causation under s 51 from scope under s 52, signpost exceptional departures, and confront interveners with Wallace's normative lens to keep liability tightly reasoned.

why_it_matters: |
  Exams punish conflating causation limbs. Sequencing ss 51–52 lets you cite the right authorities, rebut 'material risk' shortcuts, and analyse interveners with Wallace's normative lens—hallmarks of H1 reasoning.
