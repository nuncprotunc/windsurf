  Issue.
  When does a duty arise to protect a plaintiff from relational pure economic loss triggered by third-party property damage or business interruption?

  Rule.
  The duty to avoid relational pure economic loss is exceptional. Mere foreseeability is insufficient. A salient features analysis (Perre v Apand (1999) 198 CLR 180; Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258) asks whether:
    - the plaintiff or class is determinate and known to the defendant;
    - the defendant controlled the risk or assumed responsibility;
    - the plaintiff was vulnerable, lacking reasonable contractual or insurance protections;
    - recognising the duty coheres with contractual and statutory frameworks.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Confirm the loss is pure economic loss, not consequential on physical damage to the plaintiff.
  (2) Identify a determinate, known plaintiff or class.
  (3) Establish the defendant's knowledge, control, or assumption of responsibility.
  (4) Demonstrate vulnerability: no realistic contractual, insurance, or market self-protection.
  (5) Check coherence with existing contractual allocations and statutory schemes.

  Authorities map.

  - Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16.  
  - Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners SP 61288 [2014] HCA 36.

  Statutory hook.

  - Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) ss 18, 236 (ACL overlay).

  Tripwires.
  Refer to the `tripwires` key for rapid-fire pitfalls.

  Conclusion.
  Evaluate determinacy, control, vulnerability, and coherence to conclude whether the salient features justify imposing a duty.

      Issue
        Business shutdowns / third-party damage?
      Rule
        Foreseeability is not enough
        Salient features: known class • control/knowledge • vulnerability
        Coherence with contracts/statutes
      Application
        Confirm pure loss; isolate determinate class
        Establish control/assumption and knowledge of risk
        Show vulnerability; check coherence and conclude on duty
      Authorities
        Perre v Apand
        Stavar
      Statute
        Wrongs Act Pt IVAA (apportionment context)
        ACL s 18 / s 236 (overlay)
  ```

tripwires:
  - "Assuming pure economic loss duties arise on foreseeability alone."
  - "Collapsing vulnerability into mere financial exposure without self-protection analysis."
  - "Ignoring contractual/statutory coherence when weighing salient features."
  - "Treating proportionate liability or ACL overlays as duty substitutes instead of separate regimes."

why_it_matters: |
  Melbourne Law School exams reward rigorous application of the salient features test beyond mere foreseeability. Strong answers isolate a determinate plaintiff or class, critically analyse vulnerability and contractual risk allocation, and integrate statutory overlays such as the Wrongs Act Pt IVAA and the Australian Consumer Law with a concise, policy-based conclusion.
