# 0017-vicarious-liability-master.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Assuming all employee torts are in course of employment.
2. Misclassifying workers based on a single factor.
3. Neglecting the Deatons test for battery cases.
4. Confusing vicarious liability with non-delegable duties.

### Rationale
- Common error; students often overlook the need for a thorough analysis of the employment context.
- Students may focus on one factor, leading to incorrect classifications.
- Deatons is crucial for intentional torts; ignoring it can lead to flawed conclusions.
- Vicarious liability and non-delegable duties are distinct; conflating them can mislead the analysis.

root((Vicarious Liability))
  A. Issue
    Liability for employee torts
  B. Rule
    Employee + course of employment
    Multifactorial test: control, integration, risk
    Exclude independent contractors
  C. Application
    Classify worker, connect tort to employment
    Assess proximity to duties, benefit to employer
    Consider intentional torts, test unauthorised mode
  D. Limits/Statutes
    s 48 WA (Vic)
    Pt VBA caps for personal injury
  E. Authorities
    Stevens v Brodribb
    Deatons v Flew
    Relevant case law
