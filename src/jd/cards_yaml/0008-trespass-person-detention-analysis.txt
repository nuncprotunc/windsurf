  Issue.
  In shopkeeper/police detention, which trespass torts arise (battery, assault, false imprisonment) and is restraint justified by statute or consent?

  Rule.
  - False imprisonment: total restraint of freedom of movement; no reasonable means of egress. Once restraint is shown, onus shifts to D to justify lawfulness (e.g., statutory power, consent). Bird v Jones (1845) 7 QB 742 â€” partial obstruction â‰  false imprisonment. Murray v Ministry of Defence [1988] 1 WLR 692 (HL, UK persuasive) and Myer Stores Ltd v Soo (1991) 2 VR 597 (Vic CA) â€” shopkeeper detention guidance.
  - Battery: direct, intentional contact; no â€œhostilityâ€ requirement; contact can be through clothing/objects. Williams v Milotin (1957) 97 CLR 465.
  - Assault: reasonable apprehension of imminent unlawful contact; no contact required.
  - Entry onto land usually rests on an implied licence; exceeding it vitiates authority: Halliday v Nevill (1984) 155 CLR 1, 10â€“11.
  - Aggravated and exemplary damages may be awarded for high-handed trespasses: Fontin v Katapodis (1962) 108 CLR 177, 183â€“184; New South Wales v Ibbett (2006) 229 CLR 638, 647 [28].
  - Consent and necessity remain complete defences if established.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Classify the torts: contact (battery), apprehension (assault), total restraint (false imprisonment).
  (2) Identify the actor (shopkeeper, security, police) and their purpose.
  (3) Demand proof of statutory preconditions and proportional force.
  (4) Test entry authority and implied-licence limits.
  (5) Shopkeeper/citizen arrest (practical test): (a) reasonable grounds to suspect an indictable offence/theft; (b) purpose = investigate/hand to police; (c) duration no longer than reasonably necessary; (d) force reasonable/proportionate; (e) call police without undue delay (Myer Stores v Soo supports these considerations).
  (6) If detention is claimed lawful, test Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) ss 458â€“459 (arrest without warrant) and s 462A (force); for federal police, Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ss 3W, 3ZC. (Verify current numbering before an exam.)
  (7) Remedies: compensatory damages; consider aggravated and exemplary awards.

  Authorities map.
  - Williams v Milotin â€” Battery definition.
  - Bird v Jones (UK persuasive) â€” partial obstruction â‰  total restraint.
  - Murray v Ministry of Defence (HL, UK persuasive); Myer Stores v Soo (Vic CA) â€” False imprisonment onus/knowledge and shopkeeper detention.
  - Halliday v Nevill â€” Entry and implied licence guardrails.
  - Fontin v Katapodis; New South Wales v Ibbett â€” Aggravated/exemplary damages.

  Statutory hook.
  - Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) ss 458â€“459, 462A.
  - Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ss 3W, 3ZC.

  Tripwires.
  - Treating partial obstruction as false imprisonment.
  - Requiring hostility for battery.
  - Ignoring the onus shift once restraint is proved.
  - Equating suspicion with reasonable grounds for detention.

  Conclusion.
  Classify the trespasses, require statutory justification, scrutinise force and entry, and if limits are exceeded award compensatory plus aggravated and exemplary damages.

why_it_matters: |
  Shopkeeper/police detention problems are MLS staples. Examiners expect you to classify each trespass, interrogate statutory authority, note the onus shifting for false imprisonment, and structure remedies (including aggravated/exemplary damages) with precise pinpoints.
