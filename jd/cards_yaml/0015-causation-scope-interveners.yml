  Causation (Vic): how do ss 51–52 handle factual causation, exceptional cases,
    and scope when interveners appear?
back: |
  Issue.
  Has D’s negligence factually caused P’s harm and should liability extend to that harm under Wrongs Act ss 51–52 when intervening acts arise?
  
  Rule.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(1)(a) demands a “necessary condition” (but-for) link. Section 51(2) permits departure only in exceptional cases grounded in established principles. Section 52 requires the court—on P’s onus—to decide whether responsibility should extend, weighing justice and policy.
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Run but-for: deploy circumstantial inference where needed (Strong v Woolworths (2012) 246 CLR 182 at [5]–[9]); exclude bare possibility (Amaca v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36 at [49]); remember loss-of-chance limits (Tabet v Gett (2010) 240 CLR 537 at [111]–[112]).
  
  Authorities map.
  Factual causation: Strong (2012) 246 CLR 182; Amaca (2011) 246 CLR 36; Tabet (2010) 240 CLR 537. Exceptional case caution: Adeels Palace (2009) 239 CLR 420.
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 51–52, s 56; Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 140; Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) s 140.
  
  Tripwires.
  Treating s 51(2) as a material-risk escape hatch. Collapsing factual causation with scope contrary to Wallace. Assuming third-party crime satisfies causation without proof of but-for.
  
  Conclusion.
  Causation succeeds only where but-for links (or narrow exceptional principles) are proved and scope analysis—including interveners and policy—supports extending liability; absent that, confine or reject recovery.
  
why_it_matters: |
  Exams punish conflating causation limbs. Sequencing ss 51–52 lets
    you cite the right authorities, rebut “material risk” shortcuts, and analyse interveners
    with Wallace’s normative lens—hallmarks of H1 reasoning.
