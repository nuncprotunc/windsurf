# 0002-duty-existence-vs-scope-updated.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Importing Shirt calculus into existence analysis.
2. Collapsing scope into s 51 causation.
3. Missing coherence checks for public authorities.
4. Overlooking psychiatric-harm/omission gates.

### Rationale
- Shirt calculus is irrelevant to duty existence; focus on foreseeability.
- Scope must be distinct from causation under s 51; do not conflate.
- Coherence checks are essential for public authorities; do not skip.
- Psychiatric harm and omissions require specific analysis; do not overlook.

```mermaid
mindmap
root((Duty: existence vs scope))
  A. Issue
    Distinguish existence from scope
    Sequence before breach/causation
  B. Rule
    Existence: foreseeability, salient features, coherence
    Public authority duties
  C. Application
    Sequence: existence → scope → s 48 breach
    Define scope: risk, actors, setting
  D. Limits/Statutes
    s 48 WA (Vic)
  E. Authorities
    Sullivan v Moody
    Perre v Apand
    Graham Barclay Oysters
    Crimmins/Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra
    Tame/Annetts
