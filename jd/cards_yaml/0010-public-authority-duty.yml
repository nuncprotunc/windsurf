back: |
  Issue — When should a Victorian court recognise a private-law duty of care owed by a public authority to the plaintiff?

  Rule —
  - Foreseeability is necessary but not sufficient. Duty turns on salient features constrained by institutional and statutory coherence; the policy/operational distinction is a filter, not an immunity.
  - Central indicators: the authority’s control, knowledge, assumption/responsibility, reliance/vulnerability, and risks of indeterminate liability.
  - Key authorities: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562, 579–580 [49]–[53]; Pyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330, [347]–[349], [355]–[357] (verify pinpoints).

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Statutory coherence gate: identify the empowering scheme, its purpose/limits, and any preconditions.
  (2) Characterise the impugned act/omission (policy vs operational) and any specific undertaking or control.
  (3) Evaluate salient features (control; vulnerability/reliance; knowledge; indeterminacy; autonomy).
  (4) Check consistency with remedial/rights frameworks and resource allocation provisions.
  - Supporting authorities: Hunter and New England Local Health District v McKenna (2014) 253 CLR 270, 279–284 [17]–[40]; Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra (2009) 237 CLR 215, 230–236 [43]–[81]; Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258, [103].

  Authorities map —
  - Sullivan v Moody — Coherence limits on duty recognition.
  - Pyrenees Shire Council v Day — Fire inspection duties; policy/operational calibration.
  - Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra — Control/statutory preconditions.
  - Hunter v McKenna — Statutory coherence and resource constraints.
  - Stavar — Salient-features synthesis.

  Statutory hook —
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 (general negligence); ss 83–85 (public-authority principles, resource and responsibility filters).
  - Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) ss 7, 21, 38 — coherence check, not a direct cause of action.

  Tripwires —
  - Treating policy/operational as automatic immunity.
  - Assuming a general governmental rescue duty to prevent third-party harm.
  - Ignoring statutory purpose or resource-allocation limits when framing duty.
  - Conflating third-party wrongdoing with control/assumption by the authority.
  - Skipping Charter coherence before extending duty.

  Conclusion — No standing duty exists; recognition is most likely where the authority undertook or controlled a specific operational function, knew of a discrete risk to a vulnerable plaintiff who reasonably relied, and recognition aligns with the statute and rights framework.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems often involve councils, police, or health services. This card supplies an IRAC gateway focused on statutory coherence, policy/operational character, and salient features, avoiding common errors (assuming a rescue duty; merits-review drift; ignoring resource limits and Charter coherence). The cited pinpoints enable fast, authoritative duty analysis under exam pressure.

mnemonic: "POLAR-CC → Policy vs Operational → Legal coherence → Assumption/Responsibility → Reliance/Vulnerability → Control → Charter & causation"

      Issue
        Recognise negligence duty against authority?
      Rule
        Foreseeability necessary, not sufficient
        Salient features: control/assumption • reliance/vulnerability • indeterminacy
        Coherence discipline (keep systems/statutes consistent)
      Application
        Statutory gate: purpose, preconditions, resources
        Policy vs operational; specific undertaking/control
        Conclude on duty; keep breach (s 48) distinct
      Authorities
        Sullivan v Moody
        Pyrenees Shire v Day
      Statute
        Wrongs Act ss 83–85 (public-authority principles)
        Wrongs Act s 48; Charter coherence (ss 7, 21, 38)
