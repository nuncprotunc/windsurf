## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Don't overlook the 'significant injury' certificate requirement.
2. Avoid conflating aggravated and exemplary damages.
3. Ensure proper application of statutory caps.
4. Neglecting to cite the lead authority can weaken your argument.

### Rationale
- Common error is failing to identify the certificate requirement under Pt VBA.
- Students often confuse the nature of damages, leading to incorrect characterisation.
- Statutory caps are crucial; misapplication can result in incorrect damage assessments.
- Citing authorities strengthens arguments; omission can lead to lower marks.
