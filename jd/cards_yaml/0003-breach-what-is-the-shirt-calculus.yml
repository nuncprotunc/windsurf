  Issue.
  Identify when a defendant falls below the reasonable-response standard under Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 once duty is already established.
  
  Rule.
  The Shirt calculus asks whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions by weighing: (1) foreseeability (not far‑fetched or fanciful) (Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112, 121; s 48(1)(a)); (2) not insignificant risk (s 48(1)(b)); (3) probability and seriousness of harm; (4) burden of precautions; and (5)
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Frame the specific risk without hindsight (s 49). 2) Establish foreseeability and “not insignificant” risk (s 48(1)(a)–(b)). 3) Evaluate s 48(2)(a)–(d): probability, seriousness, burden, social utility — cite fact anchors (public authority, recreation, vulnerable plaintiff).
  
  Authorities map.
  Threshold and balancing: Wyong v Shirt 146 CLR 40, 47–48; Wrongs Act s 48(1)–(2). Foreseeability: Chapman 106 CLR 112, 121; Vairy 223 CLR 422.
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48–49, 51.
  
  Tripwires.
  
  Conclusion.
  Breach is established only if the s 48 balance shows a reasonable person would have taken additional precautions; keep causation and CN in their own steps.
  
why_it_matters: |
  This is the core exam scaffold for breach. Starting at s 48(1) forces
    precise risk identification and the “not insignificant” screen; s 48(2) then structures
    a proportional response to probability, seriousness, burden, and social utility,
    with s 49–56 guardrails. Separating breach from causation (s 51) and CN earns method
    marks.

tripwires:
  - "Treating foreseeability alone as breach without proving “not insignificant” (s 48(1))."
  - "Framing the risk with hindsight rather than ex ante (s 49 guardrail)."
  - "Reducing s 48(2) to a checklist instead of a balancing exercise."
  - "Over‑relying on “obvious risk” where D’s operations created the hazard."
  - "Collapsing breach with causation instead of applying s 51 separately."
