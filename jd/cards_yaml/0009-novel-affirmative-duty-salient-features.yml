back: |
  Issue. When facts fall outside settled categories (often involving omissions or public authorities), should a new duty of care be recognised consistent with Victorian law?

  Rule. Apply the salient-features approach (Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; (2009) 75 NSWLR 649, [103]); foreseeability is necessary but insufficient. The inquiry must remain coherent with overlapping legal regimes (Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; (2001) 207 CLR 562, [42]) and respect autonomy (no general rescue duty) and legislative purpose. Public authorities must also satisfy Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 83–85; breach under s 48 is analysed only after duty.

  Application scaffold. 1) Recognised category? If the scenario fits an established duty (eg, teacher–student once authority assumed: Geyer v Downs (1977) 138 CLR 91), apply that framework. 2) Salient features: analyse foreseeability, vulnerability or capacity for self-protection, control or created risk, assumption of responsibility/reliance, indeterminacy/floodgates, autonomy, coherence with statutes/policy. 3) Public authority overlay: test statutory purpose, resource constraints, and whether the empowering Act creates or negates a duty (Wrongs Act ss 83–85). 4) Parallel statutory regimes: consider ACL s 18 reliance (Perre v Apand (1999) 198 CLR 180) and Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic) s 351 for police/mental-health contexts; apply Wrongs Act Pt XI for mental harm limits. 5) Conclude on duty, then move to breach (s 48), causation, damage separately.

  Authorities map. Salient features: Stavar 75 NSWLR 649, [103]; Perre 198 CLR 180. Coherence constraints: Sullivan v Moody 207 CLR 562, [42]. No general duty to prevent third-party crime: Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil [2000] HCA 61; (2000) 205 CLR 254, [17], [35]. Police/mental health control limits: Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra [2009] HCA 15; (2009) 237 CLR 215. Indeterminacy/policy: State of New South Wales v Godfrey [2004] NSWCA 113. Recognised category example: Geyer v Downs (1977) 138 CLR 91.

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48, 83–85; Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (eg, s 72); Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic) s 351; Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2 s 18.

  Tripwires. Treating foreseeability as sufficient for duty. Checklist-dumping all Stavar factors without identifying the decisive ones. Conflating the duty analysis with breach under s 48. Imposing affirmative duties on authorities absent control or statutory preconditions. Ignoring legislative purpose/resource constraints when assessing coherence.

  Conclusion. Deliver a factor-by-factor justification showing why duty should (or should not) be recognised, then address breach, causation and damages sequentially.
why_it_matters: 'MLS problems often hinge on novel or omissions duty. Markers reward: (1) sequencing (recognised category → salient features → coherence), (2) a public-authority discipline pass (Wrongs Act ss 83–85), and (3) clean separation of duty from breach (s 48), causation and damages. Use factor signposts as paragraph headings and justify why particular features decide these facts (do not checklist Stavar). Policy levers to mention: indeterminacy/floodgates, autonomy (no general rescue duty), statutory purpose and resources (coherence), and over-deterrence if courts impose broad affirmative duties. Tie reliance/assumption questions to ACL s 18 to show awareness of statutory remedies and potential duplication/conflict. If you apply this scaffold in 10–12 minutes, you will give a principled yes/no on duty and bank H1-level structure.'
