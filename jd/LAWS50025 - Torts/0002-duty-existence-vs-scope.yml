  Issue. How do courts distinguish duty existence from its scope, and how should you apply that sequencing in Victorian negligence so you do not collapse into breach or causation?

  Rule. Existence asks whether any duty is owed; scope asks what the duty required in the circumstances. Existence turns on foreseeability tempered by salient features and coherence (Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; (2001) 207 CLR 562, 576 [50]). Salient features include vulnerability, control, assumption/reliance, and indeterminacy (Perre v Apand [1999] HCA 36; (1999) 198 CLR 180, 225 [118]; Woolcock Street Investments [2004] HCA 16; (2004) 216 CLR 515, 529 [23]); public authority discretion and statutory coherence loom large (Graham Barclay Oysters [2002] HCA 54, 211 CLR 540, 579 [79]). Omissions generally attract no duty absent special relationships (Crimmins [1999] HCA 59; Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra [2009] HCA 15). Psychiatric harm is recognised but constrained (Tame/Annetts [2002] HCA 35). Scope narrows duty once existence is found, confining it to the risk that materialised and to context (Modbury Triangle v Anzil [2000] HCA 61; (2000) 205 CLR 254, 269 [35]).

  Application scaffold. 1) Existence: address foreseeability, salient features, and coherence (policy/statute). 2) If yes, scope: confine to the precise risk that eventuated considering vulnerability/control and third-party interventions. 3) Only then breach: apply Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48. 4) Causation/scope of liability: Wrongs Act s 51. 5) Defences/damages: contributory negligence (CN) s 26, volenti s 54, Pt VBA caps (e.g. s 28ID, s 28LE) and Pt IVAA proportionate liability if engaged; ACL s 18 may overlay.

  Authorities map. Existence: Sullivan 207 CLR 562, 576 [50]; Perre 198 CLR 180, 225 [118]; Woolcock 216 CLR 515, 529 [23]; Crimmins 200 CLR 1. Public authority coherence: Graham Barclay Oysters 211 CLR 540, 579 [79]. Omissions: Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra 237 CLR 215. Psychiatric harm: Tame/Annetts 211 CLR 317. Scope: Modbury 205 CLR 254, 269 [35].

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48, 51, 26, 54; Pt VBA (incl s 28ID, s 28LE); Pt IVAA.

  Tripwires. Conflating existence with scope. Importing the Shirt calculus into duty analysis. Ignoring omissions/psychiatric harm limits. Skipping statutory coherence for public authorities. Failing to separate breach (s 48) from causation (s 51).

  Conclusion. Sequence existence → scope → breach → causation; state each gate explicitly to show doctrinal discipline and statutory literacy.
why_it_matters: |
  Examiners reward sequenced answers: existence before scope, then breach (s 48), then causation (s 51). This avoids conflation and shows statutory literacy (Pt VBA caps; CN; volenti). Referencing Sullivan, Perre/Woolcock, Modbury and public-authority coherence earns marks for policy discipline and accuracy.

mnemonic: 'E.S.C.O.P.E.: Existence → Salient features → Coherence → Omissions/Psychiatric
  harm → Pinpoints (Wrongs Act/ACL) → Exam wrap (defences/damages)'

tripwires:
  - Conflating existence with scope instead of treating sequentially.
  - Importing the Shirt breach calculus into the duty inquiry.
  - Ignoring omissions or psychiatric-harm limits when framing existence.
  - Failing to anchor statutory defences (s 54) or damages caps (Pt VBA) once duty is found.
  - Overlooking statutory purpose/coherence for public authorities.
