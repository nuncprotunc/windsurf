front: Explain the Shirt calculus for determining breach of duty in negligence.
back: 'The Shirt calculus, from *Wyong Shire Council v Shirt* (1980) 146 CLR 40, 47–48
  (Mason J), provides the central Australian framework for determining breach of duty
  in negligence. This multi-factorial test operates after a duty has been established
  and before considering causation and damages. It requires courts to assess whether
  the defendant''s conduct fell below the standard of a reasonable person by carefully
  weighing four key factors that balance individual rights against community interests.

  **1. Foreseeability of Risk** The threshold question is whether the risk was reasonably
  foreseeable to a reasonable person in the defendant''s position. *Chapman v Hearse*
  (1961) 106 CLR 112, 121 (Windeyer J) established that the test is objective and
  the risk need only be "not far-fetched or fanciful." This has been codified in *Wrongs
  Act 1958* (Vic) s 48(1)(a) and *Civil Liability Act 2002* (NSW) s 5B(1)(a). The
  High Court in *Vairy v Wyong Shire Council* (2005) 223 CLR 422 emphasized that the
  precise manner of injury need not be foreseeable.

  **2. Probability of Harm** The court considers both the likelihood of the risk eventuating
  and the potential gravity of the resulting harm. *Bolton v Stone* [1951] AC 850,
  860 (Lord Reid) demonstrates that even foreseeable risks may be acceptable if the
  probability is sufficiently low. Conversely, *Paris v Stepney BC* [1951] AC 367,
  382 (Lord Normand) shows that the same probability may require different precautions
  for vulnerable plaintiffs. The interaction with defences is crucial here - a plaintiff''s
  contributory negligence may reduce but not eliminate the defendant''s liability
  (*Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel* (1985) 59 ALJR 492).

  **3. Burden of Taking Precautions** The court weighs the cost, difficulty, and practicality
  of eliminating or reducing the risk. *Latimer v AEC Ltd* [1953] AC 643, 653 (Lord
  Tucker) established that defendants need not take every possible precaution, only
  those that are "reasonably practicable." This is reflected in *Wrongs Act 1958*
  (Vic) s 48(1)(c). The concept of "practicality" includes both financial cost and
  broader social considerations, creating tension with the principle of full compensation
  for wrongs. The assessment of damages is directly influenced by this balance - more
  onerous precautions may be expected where the potential harm is catastrophic (*Romeo
  v Conservation Commission (NT)* (1998) 192 CLR 431).

  **4. Social Utility** The court considers whether the defendant''s conduct had social
  value that justifies the risk. *Watt v Hertfordshire CC* [1954] 1 WLR 835, 838 (Lord
  Denning) and *Daborn v Bath Tramways* [1946] 2 All ER 333, 336 (Denning J) demonstrate
  that emergency situations and public benefit may excuse risks that would otherwise
  be unacceptable. This factor creates a policy tension between individual rights
  and community welfare, particularly in cases involving public authorities (*Brodie
  v Singleton Shire Council* (2001) 206 CLR 512).

  The Shirt calculus operates within a complex statutory framework. The *Competition
  and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth) sch 2 s 18 may impose additional duties in commercial
  contexts, while the *Work Health and Safety Act 2011* (Cth) creates parallel obligations
  in employment settings. The interaction with defences is particularly important
  - the calculus informs both breach and the apportionment of damages under contributory
  negligence principles. The High Court''s decision in *Strong v Woolworths Ltd* (2012)
  246 CLR 182 demonstrates how these factors must be weighed holistically rather than
  as a checklist.'
why_it_matters: 'The Shirt calculus is the critical bridge between duty and causation
  in negligence, making it a frequent exam focus. Its four-factor structure provides
  a framework for analyzing breach that balances individual rights against community
  interests. In exams, students must avoid the common trap of treating the factors
  as a mechanical checklist - the real skill lies in weighing them holistically and
  recognizing their policy underpinnings.

  The calculus is particularly significant in professional negligence (*Rogers v Whitaker*
  (1992) 175 CLR 479), public authority liability (*Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry
  Finance Committee* (1999) 200 CLR 1), and recreational activities (*Roads and Traffic
  Authority of NSW v Dederer* (2007) 234 CLR 330). It forces consideration of resource
  allocation questions that go to the heart of tort law''s compensation and deterrence
  functions.

  The statutory overlay adds complexity - while *Wrongs Act 1958* (Vic) s 48 and *Civil
  Liability Act 2002* (NSW) s 5B codify the common law, they also modify it in subtle
  ways that can affect outcomes. The interaction with defences is particularly important
  - the same factors considered in breach may reappear in assessing contributory negligence
  under *Wrongs Act* s 63.

  In practice, the calculus informs risk management across multiple domains, from
  workplace safety to professional services. Its emphasis on "reasonably practicable"
  precautions creates tension between ideal safety standards and practical realities,
  a theme that resonates throughout administrative and regulatory law.'

tripwires:
- Confusing duty and breach (existence vs standard)
- Omitting statutory overlay under Wrongs Act s 48/CLA s 5B
- Ignoring social utility in emergency contexts
- Treating factors as a checklist rather than balancing exercise
- Failing to integrate with causation and defences
- Overlooking policy tensions in public authority cases
- Neglecting to consider the interaction with damages
- Misapplying the objective standard of care
