front: "Breach (Vic): how do you run Wrongs Act s 48 against Shirt when testing reasonable precautions?"
back: |
  Issue. Did D breach the Victorian negligence standard by failing to take reasonable precautions against a not-insignificant risk under Wrongs Act s 48?

  Rule. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48(1)–(2) codifies (but does not replace) the Shirt calculus. Steps: (i) identify a foreseeable risk that was known or ought to have been known; (ii) confirm it was “not insignificant” (exclude far-fetched or fanciful); (iii) ask whether a reasonable person in D’s position would have taken precautions; (iv) weigh the s 48(2) factors—probability, seriousness, burden of precautions, social utility—contextually (RTA v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330 at [136]). Public-land and recreational cases emphasise timing, knowledge and resource constraints (Vairy; Romeo; Tapp). Statutory overlays (ss 49–56) frame hindsight, warnings, obvious/inherent risks, and plaintiff awareness. Commonwealth overlays (ACL s 60; CCA s 139A) may supplement or limit duties.

  Application scaffold. 1) Classify the specific risk at the correct level of generality. 2) Test foreseeability and “not insignificant” threshold using information available when action was required. 3) Apply s 48(2)(a)–(d): probability (time-slice per Tapp), seriousness of harm, burden/cost of precautions, social utility or competing responsibilities. 4) Layer contextual factors: public authority resourcing, recreational or voluntary risk contexts, operational versus inherent hazards. 5) Check statutory overlays (s 49 anti-hindsight, s 50 warnings, ss 53–56 obvious risk/volenti, s 51–s 52 causation) and any ACL/CCA implications. 6) Conclude whether a reasonable person would have adopted additional precautions on the contemporary knowledge base.

  Authorities map. Framework: Wyong v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40; Wrongs Act s 48. Application: RTA v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330; Tapp v ABCRA [2022] HCA 11; Vairy v Wyong (2005) 223 CLR 422; Romeo v Conservation Commission (NT) (1998) 192 CLR 431; Cole v South Tweed Heads RLFC (2004) 217 CLR 469; Adeels Palace v Moubarak (2009) 239 CLR 420.

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48–56; ACL (Cth) s 60; CCA 2010 (Cth) s 139A.

  Tripwires. Treating foreseeability alone as breach without proving “not insignificant” risk. Mischaracterising the risk (too broad/narrow). Arguing breach via hindsight contrary to s 49. Treating “obvious risk” as absolute where D created/exacerbated danger. Ignoring public-resource burdens in s 48(2)(c). Collapsing breach with causation without applying s 51/s 52. Importing NSW CLA language as binding rather than persuasive.

  Conclusion. Breach is established only if, on the information reasonably available, a prudent actor would have taken cost-justified precautions under the s 48 calculus; hindsight, obvious risk rhetoric or resource pressures do not excuse avoidable risks D knew or ought to have known.
why_it_matters: |
  Exams target candidates who recite Shirt without engaging the Victorian statute. Leading with s 48(1) forces precise risk definition and the “not insignificant” filter. Weighing s 48(2) factors against contextual authorities (public land, recreation, crowd control) shows disciplined statutory reasoning, keeps breach distinct from duty and causation, and demonstrates you can integrate ACL/CCA overlays.

tripwires:
  - Treating foreseeability as sufficient without satisfying the “not insignificant” test.
  - Misstating the risk’s generality and skewing the calculus.
  - Arguing breach with hindsight contrary to s 49.
  - Relying on obvious risk where D’s operations created the hazard.
  - Ignoring resource burdens/social utility in s 48(2).
  - Collapsing breach and causation without s 51/s 52 analysis.
