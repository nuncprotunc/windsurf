  Issue.
  Identify the elements of trespass to land and the limited statutory overlays that may modify remedies or duties in Victorian problems.
  
  Rule.
  Trespass to land is actionable per se: (1) direct interference with land in the plaintiff''s possession; (2) voluntary act (no intent to trespass required, but act must be willing); (3) absence of lawful justification (consent, licence, statutory authority).
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Confirm the plaintiff had possession (actual or constructive). 2) Identify a direct physical intrusion or remaining after consent revocation (Kuru). 3) Test voluntariness; reject mistake as a defence (Plenty).
  
  Authorities map.
  Elements: Kuru 236 CLR 1, 19 [43]; Plenty 171 CLR 635, 647; Halliday 155 CLR 1, 7-8. Necessity/defences: Southwark LBC v Williams [1971] Ch 734 (UK nuance on necessity limits).
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IIA (ss 14A-14B); Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2 (ACL) ss 18, 20-22.
  
  Tripwires.
  Conflating trespass with nuisance (indirect interference). Forgetting it is actionable per se. Treating implied licence as irrevocable. Assuming mistake negates liability. Ignoring injunctions/mesne profits for continuing trespass.
  
  Conclusion.
  Once possession, direct interference, voluntariness, and lack of justification are proven, trespass is made out; address defences and tailor remedies, flagging statutory overlays where relevant.
  
why_it_matters: |
  Trespass is an MLS staple because it is actionable per se. Examiners
    expect you to separate possession, direct interference, voluntariness and justification
    quickly, then move to defences and remedies. Referencing Kuru, Plenty and Halliday,
    plus Wrongs Act Pt IIA overlays, demonstrates doctrinal precision and statutory
    literacy.
