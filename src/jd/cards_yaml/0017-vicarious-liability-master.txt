  Issue.
  When will a Victorian defendant be vicariously liable for a tort committed by another person, usually an employee, instead of leaving liability solely with the tortfeasor?

  Rule.
  Vicarious liability attaches only if the tortfeasor is an employee and the tort is committed in the course of employment. Classify status using the multifactorial test: control, integration, delegation rights, supply of tools, allocation of enterprise risk, and remuneration structure (Stevens v Brodribb (1986) 160 CLR 16, 29â€“30). Intentional torts may still be â€œin courseâ€ if the enterprise risk materialised and the act was an unauthorised mode of the authorised task (Deatons v Flew (1949) 79 CLR 370, 381â€“382).

  Application scaffold.
  1) Identify the tortfeasor and walk through each indicator, explaining why contractor hallmarks (independence, own business, assumption of risk) are outweighed by employment features.
  2) Link the tort to employment by testing temporal and geographic proximity, benefit to the employer, and whether enterprise risk materialised; exclude frolics or personal vendettas.
  3) For intentional torts or institutional settings, show how the unauthorised mode analysis keeps liability within or outside the course of employment.
  4) Address statutory overlays: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 breach calculus, Pt VBA damages caps, and any indemnity or contribution regimes.
  5) Conclude with liability, remedies, and follow-up issues such as contribution, insurance, or compliance responses.

  Authorities map.
  - Stevens v Brodribb (1986) 160 CLR 16, 29â€“30 â€” Multifactorial employment classification; contractors typically outside vicarious liability.
  - Deatons v Flew (1949) 79 CLR 370, 381â€“382 â€” Intentional torts as unauthorised modes when enterprise risk is engaged.

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 â€” Reasonable-response calculus for employer precautions.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt VBA â€” Damages thresholds and caps for personal injury claims.

  Tripwires.
  - Assuming every employee tort is automatically "in course".
  - Misclassifying a contractor by privileging a single indicator.
  - Ignoring Deatons v Flew when intentional battery is pleaded.
  - Conflating vicarious liability with non-delegable duties.

  Conclusion.
  Deliver the classification, connect the tort to enterprise risk, address statutory overlays, and state liability plus remedial consequences so the advice remains exam-ready.

why_it_matters: |
  Vicarious liability frequently couples with breach and damages in Victorian exams. High-band answers classify the relationship, isolate enterprise risk, and explain intentional tort coverage while name-checking Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 and Pt VBA caps. Doing so avoids conflating non-delegable duties, meets statutory literacy expectations, and flags contribution or insurance follow-up.
