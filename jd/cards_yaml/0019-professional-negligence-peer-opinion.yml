front: "In a professional negligence problem, how do you apply Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic)"
ss 57–60 to classify the standard of care and assess any peer professional opinion: {}
defence?: {}
back: |
  Issue.
  Does the defendant meet the Division 5 professional standard or have a valid s 59 defence?
  
  Rule.
  Section 57 defines a "professional" and "professional service"; anyone holding out a particular skill owes the care reasonably expected of a practitioner of that skill at the time (s 58).
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Identify the professional and professional service under s 57. 2) Classify the allegation: warnings (apply Rogers/Wallace; s 60 bars s 59) versus diagnosis/treatment/practice.
  
  Authorities map.
  Duty/warnings: Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479, 490–493; Wallace v Kam (2013) 250 CLR 375, [34]–[40].
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 57–60.
  
  Tripwires.
  Applying s 59 to warnings/information (barred by s 60). Treating expert evidence as sufficient without proving national, time‑specific acceptance. Assuming unanimity or local custom is required (s 59(3) allows multiple opinions).
  
  Conclusion.
  
why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems demand disciplined sequencing: define the professional
    field (s 57), separate warnings (s 60) from practice (s 59), and make the defendant
    prove each statutory element, including national scope and timing. High‑band answers
    show the court’s supervisory role (Naxakis), deploy Tanah Merah to test reasonableness,
    and integrate Rogers/Wallace for warnings. Scripts that treat expert evidence or
    local custom as dispositive, forget the burden, or ignore s 59(3)’s allowance for
    competing opinions lose marks.
