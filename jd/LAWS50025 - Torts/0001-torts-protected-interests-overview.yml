  Issue. Classify the claimant’s protected interest (injury, property, pure economic loss) so you can deploy the correct Victorian framework and statutory overlays.

  Rule. Three scaffolds: (1) Personal injury — duty/breach owed to bodily integrity, refined by Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479, 490–493 (material-risk warnings) and Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112 (foreseeability not far‑fetched). (2) Property — exclusive possession underpins trespass/conversion; interference requires directness (Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 St Tr 1029) and remoteness (Overseas Tankship (Wagon Mound No 1) [1961] AC 388). (3) Pure economic loss — salient features guard against indeterminate liability (Perre v Apand (1999) 198 CLR 180; Woolcock Street v CDG (2004) 216 CLR 515; Brookfield Multiplex (2014) 254 CLR 185); relational loss remains exceptional (Caltex Oil (Australia) v The Dredge ‘Willemstad’ (1976) 136 CLR 529). Statutory overlays: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48, 51, Pt VBA (caps/thresholds).

  Application scaffold. 1) Identify possession or economic relationships to confirm the interest; deal with overlaps (injury + economic). 2) Apply interest-specific test: injury — negligence/intentional torts plus mental-harm filters; property — check possession, direct interference, nuisance reasonableness; economic — articulate salient features (control, vulnerability, reliance, indeterminacy). 3) Consider statutory overlays (Part VBA caps, s 48 breach, s 51 causation) and defences (contributory negligence (CN), statutory authority). 4) Evaluate policy coherence: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562 (no conflicting duties), Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre v Anzil (2000) 205 CLR 254 (third-party criminal acts). 5) Conclude with remedies (injunctions/nominal damages for property; economic loss limited to defined relationships).

  Authorities map. Injury: Rogers 175 CLR 479, 490–493; Chapman 106 CLR 112. Property: Entick 19 St Tr 1029; Wagon Mound (No 1) [1961] AC 388 (UK nuance on remoteness). Economic: Perre 198 CLR 180; Woolcock 216 CLR 515; Brookfield 254 CLR 185; Caltex Oil 136 CLR 529. Coherence/limits: Sullivan v Moody 207 CLR 562; Modbury 205 CLR 254.

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48, 51; Pt VBA (including s 28G significant injury threshold).

  Tripwires. Watch for category drift (eg, consequential vs pure economic loss), treating salient features as rigid elements, skipping Pt VBA caps, or eliding mental-harm gates when reframing injury; see `tripwires:` for the applied checklist.

  Conclusion. Interest classification drives the duty/breach test, defences, and damages; state the scaffold explicitly before analysing facts.
why_it_matters: |
  Under exam pressure, triage by interest controls the entire answer. Injury uses negligence/intentional‑tort scaffolds and Pt VBA caps; property turns on possession, directness, and remoteness; economic loss demands salient features and coherence. Sequencing avoids conflation and earns method marks. Pinpointing Wrongs Act s 48/s 51 and leading authorities signals accuracy and statutory literacy.
