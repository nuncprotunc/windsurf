# 0012-pure-economic-loss-relational.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Assuming pure economic loss duties arise on foreseeability alone.
2. Collapsing vulnerability into mere financial exposure without self-protection analysis.
3. Ignoring contractual/statutory coherence when weighing salient features.
4. Treating proportionate liability or ACL overlays as duty substitutes instead of separate regimes.

### Rationale
- Foreseeability alone does not establish a duty; salient features must be assessed.
- Vulnerability requires a deeper analysis beyond financial exposure; self-protection is key.
- Coherence with contracts/statutes is essential for duty recognition; neglecting this is a common error.
- Proportionate liability and ACL overlays serve different purposes; conflating them leads to misapplication.

root((Relational Pure Economic Loss))
  A. Issue
    Duty for business shutdowns/third-party damage?
  B. Rule
    Duty is exceptional
    Salient features: known class • control/knowledge • vulnerability
    Coherence with contracts/statutes
  C. Application
    Confirm pure loss; identify determinate class
    Establish control/knowledge of risk
    Show vulnerability; check coherence
  D. Limits/Statutes
    s 48 WA (Vic)
    ACL s 18, s 236 (overlay)
  E. Authorities
    Perre v Apand
    Caltex Refineries
    Woolcock Street
