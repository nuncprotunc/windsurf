# S001-defamation-core-elements-and-key-defences.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Failing to apply statutory constraints in order.
2. Confusing defences with elements.
3. Neglecting to cite lead authorities.
4. Overlooking the distinction between economic loss types.

### Rationale
- Students often miss the importance of applying statutory constraints sequentially.
- Defences and elements are distinct; conflating them can lead to incorrect conclusions.
- Citing lead authorities is crucial for establishing legal principles.
- Understanding the difference between consequential and pure economic loss is essential for accurate application.
