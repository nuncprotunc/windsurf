  Issue. Classify the claimant’s protected interest so correct Victorian framework and statutes anchor the answer before breach or remedy.

  Rule. Personal injury uses negligence/intentional scaffolds with material-risk warnings (Rogers v Whitaker) and a foreseeability floor (Chapman v Hearse). Property turns on exclusive possession and direct interference (Entick) with remoteness kept to reasonable foreseeability (Wagon Mound (No 1) — persuasive). Pure economic loss is exceptional: salient features of vulnerability, control, reliance, and indeterminacy confine duty (Perre; Woolcock; Brookfield) and relational loss stays narrow (Caltex Oil). Coherence checks from Sullivan v Moody and Modbury Triangle prevent conflicting obligations. Statutory overlays include Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48, s 51, Pt VBA caps, plus allied defences.

  Application scaffold. 1) Name the factual interest and flag any overlap or consequential loss. 2) Apply the tailored test: injury — duty/breach plus mental-harm gates; property — possession, directness, nuisance reasonableness, remedies; economic — salient features and coherence. 3) Layer Wrongs Act requirements (ss 26, 48, 51, Pt VBA) with defences such as volenti (s 54) or statutory authority. 4) Close with the matching remedy.

  Authorities map. Injury: Rogers; Chapman. Property: Entick; Wagon Mound (No 1). Economic: Perre; Woolcock; Brookfield; Caltex Oil. Coherence: Sullivan v Moody; Modbury.

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 48, 51, 54; Pt VBA (incl s 28G threshold).

  Tripwires. Avoid collapsing consequential into pure economic loss, skipping Pt VBA thresholds, turning salient features into rigid elements, or ignoring mental-harm filters when reframing injury.

  Conclusion. Lead with the interest classification, then integrate doctrine, statutes, and coherence so the remedy flows logically.
why_it_matters: |
  Under exam pressure, triage by interest controls the entire answer. Injury uses negligence/intentional‑tort scaffolds and Pt VBA caps; property turns on possession, directness, and remoteness; economic loss demands salient features and coherence. Sequencing avoids conflation and earns method marks. Pinpointing Wrongs Act s 48/s 51 and leading authorities signals accuracy and statutory literacy.
