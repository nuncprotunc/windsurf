front: "Breach — How do you run the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 calculus (vs common-law Shirt) when assessing reasonable precautions?"

  Issue. Did D breach the standard of care owed to P under Victorian negligence law?

  Rule. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48(1)–(2) codifies the breach calculus without displacing Wyong Shire Council v Shirt [1980] HCA 12; (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47–48 (Mason J). First, isolate a foreseeable risk (known or ought to have been known) that is “not insignificant” (insignificant = far-fetched or fanciful) (s 48(1)(a)–(b)). Second, confirm that, in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would have taken precautions (s 48(1)(c)). Third, weigh the s 48(2) factors—(a) probability of harm, (b) likely seriousness, (c) burden of precautions, (d) social utility of the activity—treating the list as a contextual framework rather than a closed checklist (RTA v Dederer [2007] HCA 42; (2007) 234 CLR 330 at [136]).

  Public-land and recreational authorities stress fact-sensitivity and timing: Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; (2005) 223 CLR 422; Romeo v Conservation Commission (NT) [1998] HCA 5; (1998) 192 CLR 431 at 487–488 [152]; Tapp v Australian Bushmen’s Campdraft & Rodeo Assn Ltd [2022] HCA 11; (2022) 396 ALR 1 at [127]–[129], [150]–[156]. Section 49 guards against hindsight, s 50 frames warning duties, and ss 53–56 address obvious/inherent risks, voluntary assumption, and plaintiff awareness. Commonwealth overlays—ACL (Cth) sch 2 s 60 (due care in services) and CCA s 139A (recreational waivers limited to personal injury/death)—may reframe obligations.

  Application. (1) Articulate the specific risk at the correct generality. (2) Confirm it was foreseeable, not insignificant, and that a reasonable person would have taken some precautions on the information available when action was required. (3) Apply s 48(2)(a)–(d): probability (time-slice per Tapp), seriousness, burden, social utility/competing responsibilities (cf Cole v South Tweed Heads RLFC [2004] HCA 29; (2004) 217 CLR 469). (4) Factor in context: public authority constraints (Vairy; Romeo), recreational risk characterisation (Tapp), maintenance/operation failures versus inherent risk. (5) Address statutory overlays—warnings (s 50), obvious risk/volenti (ss 53–56), causation guardrails (s 51 scope/factual causation; s 52 burden), and ACL/CCA implications. (6) Weigh the features holistically—do not tick boxes—and conclude whether a reasonable person in D’s position would have taken additional precautions.

  Conclusion. D breaches the standard of care only if a reasonable person, applying the s 48 calculus and contextual principles, would have taken cost-justified precautions at the relevant time; obvious risk or hindsight alone does not defeat liability where D created or exacerbated the risk.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS breach problems are designed to catch students who parrot Shirt without engaging with the Victorian statutory structure. Starting with s 48(1) forces you to pin down the precise risk and confirm it was “not insignificant.” The s 48(2) calculus then guides a disciplined balance between probability/seriousness and practical burdens/utility, with public-authority and recreational cases highlighting how timing, resource constraints and social utility shape reasonableness. Sections 49–56 provide guardrails: anti-hindsight, nuanced warning duties, and limits on “obvious risk” defences. Overlaying ACL s 60 and CCA s 139A shows examiners you can integrate parallel obligations and waiver limits. This structured approach keeps breach distinct from duty and causation, surfaces policy tensions (safety vs autonomy/resource allocation), and demonstrates H1-level command of statutory mechanics.

tripwires:
  - Treating foreseeability alone as breach without proving “not insignificant” risk (s 48(1)).
  - Framing the risk too broadly/narrowly, skewing the calculus.
  - Using hindsight to argue breach contrary to s 49 and Dederer.
  - Relying on “obvious risk” as a complete defence when D’s maintenance/operations created the hazard.
  - Ignoring the practical burden/social utility of precautions in public-resource contexts.
  - Confusing obvious risk (s 53) with inherent risk (s 55) or mere plaintiff awareness (s 56).
  - Treating risk characterisation as outcome-driven rather than ex ante (cf Tapp).
  - Importing NSW Civil Liability Act wording as binding rather than persuasive.
  - Collapsing breach and causation without separately applying s 51/s 52.
