# 0007-proportionate-liability-pt-ivaa.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Failing to plead proportionate liability early (s 24AJ)
2. Assuming all claims are apportionable without isolating economic loss (s 24AF)
3. Neglecting to identify concurrent wrongdoers (Hunt & Hunt guidance)
4. Overlooking settlement consequences (s 24AK) and exclusions (s 24AM)

### Rationale
- Early pleading is crucial to avoid waiver of rights.
- Only economic/property loss from negligence is apportionable; ACL/Corporations claims need isolation.
- Identifying concurrent wrongdoers is essential to maintain arguments.
- Settlement and exclusion provisions must be managed to preserve rights.

root((Pt IVAA — Prop. Liability))
  A. Issue
    When does Pt IVAA engage (incl. mixed claims)?
  B. Rule
    s 24AF: apportionable = econ/property loss from failure to take reasonable care
    s 24AJ: plead early + serve notice; name/describe concurrent wrongdoers
    Carve-outs: s 24AM exclusions; s 24AK settlement bar/limits
  C. Apply
    Map each loss; isolate apportionable slice
    Confirm loss is economic/property from negligence
    Test for multiple wrongdoers (Hunt & Hunt)
  D. Statutory hook
    s 24AF–24AP (focus on s 24AF, s 24AJ, s 24AK, s 24AM)
  E. Authorities
    Hunt & Hunt (2013) 247 CLR 613
    ABN Amro (2014) 224 FCR 1
