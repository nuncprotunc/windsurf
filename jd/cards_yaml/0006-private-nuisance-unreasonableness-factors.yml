  Issue.
  Which factors decide if interference with land use is unreasonable in private nuisance, and how do Victorian statutory overlays inform that balance?
  
  Rule.
  Unreasonableness is multi-factorial: sensitivity (only ordinary users protected: Robinson v Kilvert (1889) 41 Ch D 88, 96 (CA)); locality (character of neighbourhood: Sturges v Bridgman (1879) 11 Ch D 852, 865 (CA), planning permits relevant); duration/frequency (persistent interference more actionable: Munro v Southern Dairies [1955] VLR 332, 336)
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Identify occupier status and interference (noise, odour, physical damage). 2) Apply the factors: sensitivity, locality, duration/frequency, utility, malice, type of harm; cite Hargrave/Fennell/Pullen for Australian context. 3) Examine statutory authority or planning approvals (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) pt XII ss 83–85; EPA licences).
  
  Authorities map.
  Core factors: Robinson v Kilvert 41 Ch D 88, 96; Sturges v Bridgman 11 Ch D 852, 865; Munro [1955] VLR 332, 336; Bamford v Turnley 122 ER 25, 32–33; Hollywood Silver Fox Farm
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) pt XII ss 83–85; Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic) s 38; Environment Protection Act 2017 (Vic) pt 5.3; Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006
  
  Tripwires.
  Conflating nuisance with trespass. Assuming public benefit excuses nuisance. Treating exceptional sensitivity as actionable. Ignoring statutory authority or planning approvals. Ordering blanket injunctions without Shelfer proportionality.
  
  Conclusion.
  Argue unreasonableness by weighing the factors, then integrate statutory authorisations and tailored remedies; ensure Australian apex authority anchors your analysis.
  
why_it_matters: "Private nuisance fact patterns hinge on articulating the multi-factor balance and remedies. Bringing in Hargrave, Fennell, Pullen plus Wrongs Act pt XII, EPA overlays, and Shelfer reasoning shows MLS examiners you can integrate doctrine, statute and policy."
