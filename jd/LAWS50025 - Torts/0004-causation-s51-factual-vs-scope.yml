  Issue. Has D’s negligence factually caused P’s harm and should liability extend to that harm under the Wrongs Act without collapsing factual causation into scope of liability?

  Rule. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(1)(a) requires that D’s negligence be a “necessary condition” of the harm (but-for). Statements about what P would have done are generally inadmissible unless against interest (s 51(3)–(4)). Section 51(2) allows departure from but-for only in exceptional cases by reference to established principles (e.g., exceptional policy categories). Section 52 asks whether it is appropriate that liability extend to the harm (scope), with P bearing the onus (s 52(1)(b)). Proof remains on the balance of probabilities calibrated under Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) / 2008 (Vic) s 140.

  Application scaffold. 1) Factual causation: run the but-for test and build circumstantial inference where direct proof is lacking (Strong v Woolworths (2012) 246 CLR 182, [5]–[9]); distinguish inference from mere possibility (Amaca v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36, [49]); keep March v Stramare (1991) 171 CLR 506 in mind. 2) Exceptional cases (s 51(2)): use only when established principles justify departure; Adeels (2009) 239 CLR 420, [52]–[57] rejects “material increase in risk” shortcuts for third-party crime. 3) Scope (s 52): test intervening acts — Adeels for security failures, Mahony (1985) 156 CLR 522, 529–530 for negligent medical treatment, Haber [1963] VR 339, 348–350 for suicide after injury-induced mental illness, Yates (1990) 24 NSWLR 317 for plaintiff criminality. 4) Keep defendant-by-defendant analysis; apportionment only after causation is proved.

  Authorities map. But-for and inference: Strong 246 CLR 182, [5]–[9]; Amaca 246 CLR 36, [49]; March 171 CLR 506. Exceptional restraint: Adeels 239 CLR 420, [52]–[57]. Scope boundary: s 52; Wallace v Kam (2013) 250 CLR 375, [9]–[12]; Mahony 156 CLR 522, 529–530; Haber [1963] VR 339, 348–350; Yates 24 NSWLR 317. Normative closure: s 52 and Evidence Act s 140.

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 51–52 (with s 51(2), s 52(1)(b)); Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) / 2008 (Vic) s 140.

  Tripwires. Treating s 51(2) as a generic “material increase in risk” escape hatch. Collapsing factual causation and scope. Assuming third-party crime stays within scope without proving but-for. Treating routine medical negligence as breaking the chain contrary to Mahony.

  Conclusion. Prove factual causation under s 51(1)(a) (resisting s 51(2) shortcuts), then decide scope under s 52 with authority-driven analysis before turning to apportionment or defences.

why_it_matters: |
  Examiners penalise conflation. Sequencing s 51(1)(a) but-for → s 51(2) exceptional → s 52 scope lets you deploy the right authority at each node. Strong/Amaca show how to build or resist inference; Adeels limits shortcuts; Wallace frames the normative limb; Mahony and Haber keep you honest on medical negligence and suicide.
