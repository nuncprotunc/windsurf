front: Under Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), when (and how) is proportionate
  liability engaged, especially with mixed claims and timing/pleading triggers?

  Issue. When does Pt IVAA apportionment apply to Victorian economic loss or property damage, and how do mixed claims plus pleading timing affect engagement?

  Rule. Pt IVAA applies only to apportionable claims for economic loss or property damage arising from a failure to take reasonable care (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 24AF). Defendants must plead the defence under court rules (no statutory pleading section). Non-apportionable components (eg, personal injury) remain jointly and severally liable (Hunt & Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees Pty Ltd (2013) 247 CLR 613, 638 [27]). Exclusions: s 24AG (personal injury), s 24AM (intentional/fraud). ACL s 18 claims are caught (s 24AF(1)(b)), but Selig v Wealthsure Pty Ltd (2015) 255 CLR 661, 673 [34] confirms apportionment only for the same loss.

  Application scaffold. 1) Engagement: isolate economic/property loss caused by failure to take reasonable care (s 24AF). 2) Mixed claims: carve out non-apportionable causes (ACL s 236, Corporations Act s 1041I) per ABN Amro Bank NV v Bathurst Regional Council (2014) 224 FCR 1, 58 [114]; leave them under joint/several liability. 3) Plead/timing: raise the PL defence promptly; identify concurrent wrongdoers (s 24AH) and seek joinder under s 24AL to avoid empty-chair risk. 4) Consequences: settlement with one wrongdoer does not bar claims against others (s 24AK); contribution is barred (s 24AJ); apply contributory negligence (s 24AN) after apportionment. 5) Carve-outs/transitional: exclude intentional conduct (s 24AM); check transitional s 24AS; consider strategic settlement and discovery.

  Authorities map. Engagement/mixed claims: Hunt & Hunt 247 CLR 613, 638 [27]; ABN Amro 224 FCR 1, 58 [114]; Selig 255 CLR 661, 673 [34]. Duty/scope context: Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 515, 536 [23]. Statutory anchors: Wrongs Act ss 24AF–24AP (esp 24AG, 24AH, 24AJ, 24AK, 24AL, 24AN) and related ACL/Corporations Act provisions.

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA ss 24AF–24AP (incl 24AG, 24AH, 24AJ, 24AK, 24AL, 24AM, 24AN, 24AS); Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2 ss 18, 236; Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ss 1041H–1041I.

  Tripwires. Assuming apportionment applies automatically without pleading. Treating non-apportionable statutory claims as covered just because they are in the same proceeding. Ignoring s 24AM intentional/fraud exclusions or ACL/Corporations carve-outs. Forgetting contribution is barred (s 24AJ) and misdescribing settlement consequences (s 24AK). Folding contributory negligence into apportionment instead of addressing it after.

  Conclusion. Engage Pt IVAA by isolating the apportionable loss, pleading the defence, managing concurrent wrongdoers and statutory carve-outs, and sequencing settlement, contribution and contributory negligence deliberately.
why_it_matters: 'Understanding when proportionate liability kicks in (i.e. the engagement
  and mixed‑claim rules) is vital in commercial, negligence, professional liability,
  and statutory claim problems. In exams, marks are often lost by assuming Pt IVAA
  applies to non‑apportionable causes or by failing to plead apportionment under the
  court rules (there is no Pt IVAA statutory pleading). Strategic decisions (settling
  with one defendant, offers of compromise) depend on knowing s 24AK (subsequent actions)
  and s 24AJ (contribution bar). Policy tensions: protecting plaintiffs vs preventing
  unfair burden on one defendant; risk of "empty chair" defendants; procedural fairness
  vs efficiency. Examiners expect clear pinpoints (24AE–24AP map), apex authorities
  an H1 answer from merely competent.

tripwires:
  - Assuming apportionment applies automatically without pleading.
  - Treating non-apportionable statutory claims as covered simply because they are joined.
  - Misstating settlement consequences (remember s 24AK governs subsequent actions).
  - Ignoring s 24AM intentional/fraud exclusions or ACL/Corporations carve-outs.
  - Folding contributory negligence into apportionment instead of dealing with it afterward.
