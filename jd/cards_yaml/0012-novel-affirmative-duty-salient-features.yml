front: In a novel or affirmative-duty scenario (incl public authorities), how would
  you determine whether a duty of care should be recognised under Victorian law?
back: 'Issue. When facts do not fit a settled category, should the court recognise
  a (often positive) duty on D to act to protect P?


  Rule. Apply the salient-features approach: is it appropriate to impose a duty given
  the relationship and context (Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA
  258; (2009) 75 NSWLR 649 at [103] (Allsop P))? Foreseeability is necessary, not
  sufficient; the law must remain coherent with other regimes (Sullivan v Moody [2001]
  HCA 59; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at [42] (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne, Callinan
  JJ)).


  Application scaffold.

  Recognised category? If yes, apply it (e.g., teacher–student supervision duty once
  authority assumed: Geyer v Downs [1977] HCA 64; (1977) 138 CLR 91 (Mason J, Stephen,
  Jacobs, Murphy, Aickin JJ)).

  If not, weigh salient features: foreseeability; vulnerability/ability to self-protect;
  control/created risk; assumption of responsibility/reliance; indeterminacy; autonomy;
  coherence with statutes/policy.

  Public authorities: integrate Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 83 (resource constraints and
  scope), s 84 (statutory duty threshold) and s 85 (no duty merely from existence
  of a function) and keep breach distinct under s 48.


  Limits (illustrations). No general duty to prevent third-party crime: Modbury Triangle
  Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil [2000] HCA 61; (2000) 205 CLR 254 at [17], [35]
  (Gleeson CJ; majority). Police/mental health: no duty absent control or statutory
  preconditions: Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra [2009] HCA 15; (2009) 237 CLR 215 (French
  CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel JJ). Policy/public risk: avoid indeterminate
  liability (cf State of New South Wales v Godfrey [2004] NSWCA 113). Coherence overlays
  may point to ACL s 18 (Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2). Modern analogue
  to the statutory police power considered in Stuart is Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic)
  s 351. Mental harm overlay: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (eg s 72) limits pure mental
  harm duties in parallel.


  Conclusion. Decide duty factor-by-factor, then analyse breach (s 48), causation
  and damage separately.

  '
why_it_matters: 'MLS problems often hinge on novel or omissions duty. Markers reward:
  (1) sequencing (recognised category → salient features → coherence), (2) a public-authority
  discipline pass (Wrongs Act ss 83–85), and (3) clean separation of duty from breach
  (s 48), causation and damages. Use factor signposts as paragraph headings and justify
  why particular features decide these facts (do not checklist Stavar). Policy levers
  to mention: indeterminacy/floodgates, autonomy (no general rescue duty), statutory
  purpose and resources (coherence), and over-deterrence if courts impose broad affirmative
  duties. Tie reliance/assumption questions to ACL s 18 to show awareness of statutory
  remedies and potential duplication/conflict. If you apply this scaffold in 10–12
  minutes, you will give a principled yes/no on duty and bank H1-level structure.

tripwires:
- Treating foreseeability as sufficient for duty (see Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207
  CLR 562 at [42]).
- Checklist-dumping all Stavar factors without explaining which ones decide the case.
- Conflating duty with breach—reserve Wrongs Act s 48 for breach.
- Imposing affirmative duties on police/authorities without control or statutory preconditions
  (Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra (2009) 237 CLR 215).
- Creating indeterminate liability to the public at large (cf State of New South Wales
  v Godfrey [2004] NSWCA 113).
