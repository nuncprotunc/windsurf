front: "In a Victorian personal injury problem, how do you (i) clear the Part VBA ‘significant injury’ gateway for general damages and (ii) distinguish aggravated from exemplary damages while respecting statutory caps?"

  Issue. Has the plaintiff established eligibility for non-economic loss and ancillary heads of damage under the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), and how should aggravated and exemplary damages be characterised and limited?

  Rule. Part VBA requires a “significant injury” certificate unless an exception applies. Sections 28LB–28LK prescribe the process; s 28LF defines thresholds (generally >5% WPI for physical injury, extra criteria for psychiatric impairment via s 28LJ). Section 28LC(2)(a) exempts intentional torts done with intent to cause injury, or sexual assault/misconduct, from the gateway. Once through the threshold, Pt VB caps apply: s 28F(2) limits loss of earnings to three times average weekly earnings; s 28G sets the indexed ceiling for non-economic loss with indexation machinery in s 28H and associated Ministerial notices; ss 28IA–28IE govern gratuitous and attendant care. Aggravated damages remain compensatory, enhancing general damages for humiliation or wounded feelings (Uren v John Fairfax (1966) 117 CLR 118, 149–150 (Taylor J); Lamb v Cotogno (1987) 164 CLR 1, 13). Exemplary damages punish contumelious conduct but may be curtailed where the defendant has already been criminally punished (Gray v Motor Accident Commission (1998) 196 CLR 1, 14). The High Court has upheld combined aggravated and exemplary awards against the State for police trespass/assault (State of NSW v Ibbett [2006] HCA 57; (2006) 231 ALR 485, [20]–[21]). Provocation cannot reduce compensatory sums, though it may be relevant to aggravated or exemplary heads (Fontin v Katapodis (1962) 108 CLR 177, 182 (Owen J)). No direct Commonwealth statute regulates the Pt VBA threshold.

  Application. Step 1: Identify whether s 28LC(2)(a) applies; if not, verify significant injury via s 28LF (including psychiatric nuances under s 28LJ) or note that the plaintiff cannot recover non-economic loss. Step 2: Compute permissible heads: apply s 28F(2) to economic loss, refer to the current indexed non-economic maximum under s 28G/s 28H, and check care services against ss 28IA–28IE. Step 3: Characterise additional damages—aggravated (compensatory) versus exemplary (punitive)—and consider Gray’s constraint alongside any policy factors justifying punishment. Step 4: Integrate public policy arguments (enterprise risk, deterrence, insurance stability) to justify or resist exemplary awards.

  Conclusion. Damages depend first on breaching the Pt VBA gateway, then on meticulous application of statutory caps and proper distinction between compensatory (aggravated) and punitive (exemplary) remedies, mindful of Gray’s restraint.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS damages questions reward disciplined sequencing. Begin with the Pt VBA gate: cite s 28LC(2)(a) to see if intentional or sexual misconduct bypasses the certificate, otherwise run the s 28LF/LJ metrics. Only after eligibility do you price the claim—loss of earnings cap (s 28F(2)) and the indexed non-economic ceiling (s 28G/s 28H). Answers that recite stale dollar figures lose marks; flag that caps are indexed annually. Distinguish aggravated (compensatory) from exemplary (punitive) using Uren, Lamb and Gray, and note Ibbett to show punitive awards still bite against the State. Mention Fontin to avoid conflating provocation with mitigation of compensatory damages. This scaffold helps you survive time pressure and signals policy awareness around insurance affordability versus claimant vindication.
mnemonic: "THRESH→CAP→CHAR→POLICY: Threshold (s 28LC/28LF) → Caps (s 28F; s 28G/H) → Characterise (Aggravated vs Exemplary; Gray) → Policy (insurance vs deterrence)."

tripwires:
  - **Gateway swap**: Confusing TAC “serious injury” with Wrongs Act “significant injury”.
  - **Indexation lapse**: Stating a fixed non-economic cap without noting annual indexation under s 28G/s 28H.
  - **Mislabel**: Treating aggravated damages as punitive or double-counting with exemplary.
  - **Gray blind spot**: Claiming exemplary damages despite prior criminal punishment of the defendant.
  - **Threshold miss**: Forgetting s 28LC(2)(a) removes the significant injury requirement for intentional or sexual misconduct.
  - **Provocation slip**: Suggesting provocation reduces compensatory damages contrary to Fontin v Katapodis.
