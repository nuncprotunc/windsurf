front: "Causation (Vic): how do ss 51–52 handle factual causation, exceptional cases,\n\
  \  and scope when interveners appear?\n"
back: 'Issue.

  Has D’s negligence factually caused P’s harm and should liability extend to that
  harm under Wrongs Act ss 51-52 when intervening acts arise?

  __HD__0__

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(1)(a) demands a “necessary condition” (but-for) link.

  Section 51(2) permits departure only in exceptional cases grounded in established
  principles.

  Section 52 requires the court.

  on P’s onus.

  to decide whether responsibility should extend, weighing justice and policy.

  __HD__1__

  1) Run but-for: deploy circumstantial inference where needed (Strong v Woolworths
  (2012) 246 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 182 at [5]-[9]).

  exclude bare possibility (Amaca v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36 at [49]).

  remember loss-of-chance limits (Tabet v Gett (2010) 240 CLR 537 at [111]-[112]).

  __HD__2__

  Factual causation: Strong (2012) 246 CLR 182.

  Amaca (2011) 246 CLR 36.

  Tabet (2010) 240 CLR 537.

  Exceptional case caution: Adeels Palace (2009) 239 CLR 420.

  __HD__3__

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 51-52, s 56.

  Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 140.

  Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) s 140.

  __HD__4__

  Treating s 51(2) as a material-risk escape hatch.

  Collapsing factual causation with scope contrary to Wallace.

  Assuming third-party crime satisfies causation without proof of but-for.

  __HD__5__

  Causation succeeds only where but-for links (or narrow exceptional principles) are
  proved and scope analysis.

  including interveners and policy.

  supports extending liability.

  absent that, confine or reject recovery.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

why_it_matters: "Exams punish conflating causation limbs. Sequencing ss 51–52 lets\n\
  \  you cite the right authorities, rebut “material risk” shortcuts, and analyse\
  \ interveners\n  with Wallace’s normative lens—hallmarks of H1 reasoning.\n\n  \n"

tripwires:
- Treating s 51(2) as a material-risk shortcut.
- Collapsing factual causation with scope contrary to Wallace.
- Assuming third-party crime satisfies causation absent but-for proof.
- Letting routine medical negligence break the chain contra Mahony.
- Declaring suicide wholly voluntary despite impaired volition.
- Ignoring P’s onus and Evidence Act s 140 calibration.
