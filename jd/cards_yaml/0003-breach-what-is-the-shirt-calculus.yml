front: How do you apply the Shirt calculus to determine breach in negligence?
back: 'Issue.

  Identify when a defendant falls below the reasonable-response standard under Wrongs
  Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 once duty is already established.

  Rule.

  The Shirt calculus asks whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions
  by weighing: (1) foreseeability (not far‑fetched or fanciful) (Chapman v Hearse
  (1961) 106 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 112.

  121.

  s 48(1)(a)).

  (2) not insignificant risk (s 48(1)(b)).

  (3) probability and seriousness of harm.

  (4) burden of precautions.

  and (5) Application scaffold.

  1) Frame the specific risk without hindsight (s 49).

  2) Establish foreseeability and “not insignificant” risk (s 48(1)(a)-(b)).

  3) Evaluate s 48(2)(a)-(d): probability, seriousness, burden, social utility .

  cite fact anchors (public authority, recreation, vulnerable plaintiff).

  Threshold and balancing: Wyong v Shirt 146 CLR 40, 47-48.

  Wrongs Act s 48(1)-(2).

  Foreseeability: Chapman 106 CLR 112, 121.

  Vairy 223 CLR 422.

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48-49, 51.

  Tripwires.

  Conclusion.

  Breach is established only if the s 48 balance shows a reasonable person would have
  taken additional precautions.

  keep causation and contributory negligence (CN) in their own steps.

why_it_matters: "This is the core exam scaffold for breach. Starting at s 48(1) forces\n\
  \  precise risk identification and the “not insignificant” screen; s 48(2) then\
  \ structures\n  a proportional response to probability, seriousness, burden, and\
  \ social utility,\n  with s 49–56 guardrails. Separating breach from causation (s\
  \ 51) and CN earns method\n  marks.\n\n  \n"

tripwires:
- Treating foreseeability alone as breach without proving “not insignificant” (s 48(1)).
- Framing the risk with hindsight rather than ex ante (s 49 guardrail).
- Reducing s 48(2) to a checklist instead of a balancing exercise.
- Over‑relying on “obvious risk” where D’s operations created the hazard.
- Collapsing breach with causation instead of applying s 51 separately.
