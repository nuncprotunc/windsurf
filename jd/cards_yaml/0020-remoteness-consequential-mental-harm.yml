front: "Consequential mental harm (Vic): is psychiatric injury too remote?"

  Issue.
  Whether the plaintiff’s psychiatric injury is within the scope of liability or too remote when it follows another injury.
  
  Rule.
  Remoteness confines liability to reasonably foreseeable kinds of harm; the exact mechanism or magnitude need not be foreseen (Overseas Tankship (The Wagon Mound No 1) [1961] AC 388 (PC); Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837; Chapman v Hearse [1961] HCA 46; (1961) 106 CLR 112).
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Characterise the harm as an RPI under s 67. 2) Confirm it is consequential on another injury (s 67). 3) Apply s 74(1)(a)–(b) normal‑fortitude filter (plus known susceptibility) with s 74(2)’s circumstances.
  
  Authorities map.
  Classification of harm: s 67; RPI requirement: ss 67, 74. Statutory filter: s 74(1)–(2).
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 67, 74 (context: ss 72–73 for pure mental harm).
  
  Tripwires.
  Treating grief/worry as RPI. Ignoring s 74(2)’s inclusion of the initial injury as part of the circumstances. Importing s 72–73 pure mental harm controls into consequential claims.
  
  Conclusion.
  Consequential psychiatric injury is recoverable when an RPI of that kind was reasonably foreseeable within s 74’s framework; mere distress without RPI fails.
  
why_it_matters: |
  MLS scope questions turn on whether you run remoteness or the statutory
    mental-harm screen first. Start by classifying the claim: consequential (s 74) versus
    pure (ss 72–73). Cite s 67 to confirm the harm is a recognised psychiatric illness.
    Then apply the normal-fortitude filter and the “circumstances” extension in s 74(2)
    before finishing with remoteness (kind, not extent). Tame/Annetts and Jaensch help
    dislodge old UK “shock” control mechanisms, while Pusey supports thin-skull reasoning
    once the kind is foreseeable. Answers that collapse distress with RPI or demand
    precise mechanism predictions lose marks; sequencing statutory elements with foreseeable-kind
    analysis earns H1 credit.

  KIND–RPI–FORTITUDE: Kind foreseeable? → Recognised psychiatric illness
    (s 67) → Normal fortitude / known susceptibility (s 74) → Remoteness respects thin
    skull.

  - "Forgetting s 74(2) folds the initial injury into the foreseeability circumstances."
  - "Applying pure mental harm controls (ss 72–73) to consequential claims."
