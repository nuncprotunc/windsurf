front: "Consequential mental harm (Vic): is psychiatric injury too remote?"

  Issue.
  Whether the plaintiffâ€™s psychiatric injury is within the scope of liability or too remote when it follows another injury.
  __HD__0__
  Remoteness confines liability to reasonably foreseeable kinds of harm.
  the exact mechanism or magnitude need not be foreseen (Overseas Tankship (The Wagon Mound No 1) [1961] Appeal Cases (AC) 388 (Privy Council (PC)).
  Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837.
  Chapman v Hearse [1961] HCA 46.
  (1961) 106 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 112).
  __HD__1__
  1) Characterise the harm as an Recognised psychiatric injury (RPI) under s 67.
  2) Confirm it is consequential on another injury (s 67).
  3) Apply s 74(1)(a)-(b) normalâ€‘fortitude filter (plus known susceptibility) with s 74(2)â€™s circumstances.
  __HD__2__
  RPI requirement: ss 67, 74.
  Statutory filter: s 74(1)-(2).
  __HD__3__
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 67, 74 (context: ss 72-73 for pure mental harm).
  __HD__4__
  Failing to classify the claim as consequential (s 74) rather than pure (ss 72-73).
  Ignoring the normal-fortitude filter in s 74(1)(a)-(b) and known susceptibility data.
  Confusing mere distress with a recognised psychiatric injury (RPI) under s 67.
  Neglecting s 74(2)'s direction to assess the circumstances, including the initial injury.
  __HD__5__
  Consequential psychiatric injury is recoverable when an RPI of that kind was reasonably foreseeable within s 74â€™s framework.
  mere distress without RPI fails.
  __HD__0__
  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.
  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.
  __HD__2__
  Lead: Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 35; (2002) 211 CLR 317.
  __HD__3__
  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.
  __HD__4__
  
  - Donâ€™t exceed statutory thresholds/caps
  
  - Donâ€™t conflate consequential with pure economic loss
  
  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.
  __HD__5__
  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS scope questions turn on whether you run remoteness or the statutory
   mental-harm screen first. Start by classifying the claim: consequential (s 74) versus
   pure (ss 72â€“73). Cite s 67 to confirm the harm is a recognised psychiatric illness.
   Then apply the normal-fortitude filter and the â€œcircumstancesâ€ extension in s 74(2)
   before finishing with remoteness (kind, not extent). Tame/Annetts and Jaensch help
   dislodge old UK â€œshockâ€ control mechanisms, while Pusey supports thin-skull reasoning
   once the kind is foreseeable. Answers that collapse distress with RPI or demand
   precise mechanism predictions lose marks; sequencing statutory elements with foreseeable-kind
   analysis earns H1 credit.
