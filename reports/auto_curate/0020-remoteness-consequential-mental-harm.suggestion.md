# 0020-remoteness-consequential-mental-harm.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Failing to classify the claim as consequential (s 74) vs pure (ss 72-73).
2. Ignoring the normal-fortitude filter (s 74(1)(a)-(b)).
3. Confusing mere distress with recognised psychiatric injury (RPI).
4. Neglecting the circumstances extension in s 74(2).

### Rationale
- Classification is crucial for applying the correct statutory framework.
- The normal-fortitude filter is essential to determine liability.
- Only RPI qualifies for recovery; distress alone does not.
- Circumstances in s 74(2) are vital for assessing claims.
