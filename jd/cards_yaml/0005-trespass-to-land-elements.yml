front: What are the elements of trespass to land at common law?
back: 'Issue.

  Identify the elements of trespass to land and the limited statutory overlays that
  may modify remedies or duties in Victorian problems.

  __HD__0__

  Trespass to land is actionable per se: (1) direct interference with land in the
  plaintiff''''s possession.

  (2) voluntary act (no intent to trespass required, but act must be willing).

  (3) absence of lawful justification (consent, licence, statutory authority).

  __HD__1__

  1) Confirm the plaintiff had possession (actual or constructive).

  2) Identify a direct physical intrusion or remaining after consent revocation (Kuru).

  3) Test voluntariness.

  reject mistake as a defence (Plenty).

  __HD__2__

  Elements: Kuru 236 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 1,
  19 [43].

  Plenty 171 CLR 635, 647.

  Halliday 155 CLR 1, 7-8.

  Necessity/defences: Southwark LBC v Williams [1971] Ch 734 (United Kingdom (UK)
  nuance on necessity limits).

  __HD__3__

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt Part Part IIA (IIA) (ss 14A-14B).

  Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2 (Australian Consumer Law (Australian
  Consumer Law (ACL))) ss 18, 20-22.

  __HD__4__

  Conflating trespass with nuisance (indirect interference).

  Forgetting it is actionable per se.

  Treating implied licence as irrevocable.

  Assuming mistake negates liability.

  Ignoring injunctions/mesne profits for continuing trespass.

  __HD__5__

  Once possession, direct interference, voluntariness, and lack of justification are
  proven, trespass is made out.

  address defences and tailor remedies, flagging statutory overlays where relevant.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  Lead: Kuru v State of NSW [2008] HCA 26; (2008) 236 CLR 1, 19 [43].

  __HD__3__

  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.

why_it_matters: "Trespass is an MLS staple because it is actionable per se. Examiners\n\
  \  expect you to separate possession, direct interference, voluntariness and justification\n\
  \  quickly, then move to defences and remedies. Referencing Kuru, Plenty and Halliday,\n\
  \  plus Wrongs Act Pt IIA overlays, demonstrates doctrinal precision and statutory\n\
  \  literacy.\n\n  \n"

tripwires:
- Conflating trespass with nuisance (indirect interference).
- Forgetting trespass is actionable per se (no damage proof needed).
- Treating implied licence as irrevocable or general.
- Assuming mistake or good faith is a defence.
