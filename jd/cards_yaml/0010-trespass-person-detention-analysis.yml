front: 'Shopkeeper/police detention: classify battery, assault and false imprisonment;
  elements, onus, statutory authority (entry/force), Charter overlays, and remedies.'
back: 'Trespass to the person protects bodily integrity and liberty via three actionable‑per‑se
  torts. In detention hypotheticals, move fast: classify the tort, test lawful authority
  (including entry and force), then calibrate remedies.


  Elements and burdens

  • Battery: direct, voluntary contact without lawful justification. Hostility is
  unnecessary; everyday social touching generally outside liability (Collins v Wilcock
  [1984] 1 WLR 1172, 1178 (persuasive)). Direct interferences are actionable even
  where negligence is absent: Williams v Milotin (1957) 97 CLR 465, 474.

  • Assault: conduct causing a reasonable apprehension of imminent unlawful contact;
  words/conditional threats can suffice (Zanker v Vartzokas (1988) 34 A Crim R 11,
  18).

  • False imprisonment (FI): intentional total restraint without lawful authority
  or consent. Awareness is not required (Murray v MoD [1988] 1 WLR 692 (HL)). Once
  restraint is shown, the onus shifts to the defendant to justify (Ruddock v Taylor
  (2005) 222 CLR 612 at [140]; Myer Stores Ltd v Soo [1991] 2 VR 597, 611).


  Authority, entry and force

  • Victorian arrest/force powers: Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) s 458 (citizen’s arrest),
  s 459 (police arrest), s 459A (entry to arrest), s 461 (use of force in arrest),
  s 462A (reasonable force to prevent indictable offences). Federal overlays for federal
  offences: Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 3W (arrest without warrant), s 3ZC (reasonable
  force).

  • Entry constraint: implied licence for residential premises (Halliday v Nevill
  (1984) 155 CLR 1, 10–11). Unlawful entry taints the arrest and FI analysis.

  • Reasonable grounds are objective (especially under s 459). Excessive force converts
  to battery.


  Public law overlays and vicarious liability

  • Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) ss 10 (bodily integrity),
  12 (movement), 13(a) (privacy/home), 21 (liberty), 38 (public authority obligations)
  inform proportionality and statutory construction.

  • Public authorities can be vicariously liable for police torts (NSW v Ibbett (2006)
  229 CLR 638).


  Remedies and limitation

  • Nominal damages vindicate rights; aggravated damages for indignity/humiliation;
  exemplary damages punish egregious abuses (Fontin v Katapodis (1962) 108 CLR 177;
  Ibbett). Injunctions may restrain ongoing trespass.

  • Limitation: personal injury claims engage Limitation of Actions Act 1958 (Vic)
  Pt IIA (discoverability); pure FI otherwise within s 5’s period.


  Practical structure (R‑LARF / E‑F‑R)

  1) Restraint (total?) 2) Lawful authority (powers satisfied?) 3) Reasonable force
  4) FI/Battery/Assault classification 5) Remedies. Separately: Entry → Force → Remedies.

why_it_matters: 'MLS exams love detention fact patterns. High‑scoring answers: (1)
  pin the tort (battery/assault/FI), (2) interrogate statutory preconditions (s 458/459/459A/461/462A;
  3W/3ZC), (3) apply entry limits (Halliday implied licence), (4) assess force and
  objective “reasonable grounds”, (5) overlay Charter proportionality for state actors,
  and (6) finish with a strategic remedies calibration (nominal/aggravated/exemplary;
  injunctions). Flag onus shift in FI and that awareness is unnecessary. Use R‑LARF
  and E‑F‑R heuristics to stay disciplined under exam time pressure.

tripwires:
- Treating partial obstruction as FI (Bird v Jones foil)
- Requiring hostility for battery
- Ignoring onus shift once total restraint is proved (Ruddock; Soo)
- Treating suspicion as “reasonable grounds” under s 459 without objective basis
- Unchecked entry—implied licence limits (Halliday) taint arrest
- Assuming awareness is required for FI (Murray says no)
- Failing to convert excessive force to battery
