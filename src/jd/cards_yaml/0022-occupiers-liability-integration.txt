  Issue.
  How should a Victorian premises injury answer signal whether Pt IIA of the Wrongs Act governs, or whether ordinary negligence or trespass must run alongside the statutory duty?

  Rule.
  Part IIA abolishes entrant categories and substitutes a duty to take reasonable care that entrants avoid injury from the state of the premises or related acts or omissions (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 14B(2)â€“(3)).
  Outside that nexus the common law persists, so occupiers must still satisfy ordinary negligence standards and guard against trespass exposure.
  Breach runs through s 48 Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), causation and scope through s 51, and any obvious or inherent risk softeners sit in ss 53â€“56 with volenti in s 54.

  Application scaffold.
  1) Classify the hazard: defective state, activity or contractor system, or deliberate force.
  Preserve a trespass branch whenever force rather than condition caused the harm (Hackshaw v Shaw (1984) 155 CLR 614, 654 (Deane J)).
  2) When Pt IIA applies, explain why s 14B(3) captures the hazard, then run s 48 with explicit reference to obvious-risk provisions and occupierâ€“contractor delegation (Thompson v Woolworths (Qld) Pty Ltd (2005) 221 CLR 234, 245â€“246 [23]â€“[27]).
  3) Prove causation with inspection or system evidence; Strong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5; (2012) 246 CLR 182, 197 [44] rejects inference from injury alone.

  Authorities map.
  - Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7; (1987) 162 CLR 479, 488 â€” statutory duty replaces entrant categories.
  - Thompson v Woolworths (Qld) Pty Ltd (2005) 221 CLR 234, 245â€“246 [23]â€“[27] â€” occupier remains responsible for contractor systems.
  - Hackshaw v Shaw (1984) 155 CLR 614, 654 (Deane J) â€” trespass branch persists when force, not condition, causes harm.
  - Strong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5; (2012) 246 CLR 182, 197 [44] â€” causation demands positive inspection evidence.

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 14B(2)â€“(3), 48, 51, 53â€“56, 54.

  Tripwires.
  Reviving invitee or licensee categories post-Zaluzna.
  Treating activity hazards as outside s 14B(3).
  Ignoring obvious-risk provisions when running breach.
  Assuming causation without inspection evidence (Strong).

  Conclusion.
  Lead with hazard classification, integrate Pt IIA with s 48 and s 51 reasoning, and keep trespass ready so the pathway from duty to defences stays statute-led.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS premises injury problems mix defective conditions, contractor activity, and deliberate force under time pressure.
  Flagging Pt IIA early, sequencing s 48 and s 51 carefully, and citing Strong for causation proof shows doctrinal control while preserving a trespass branch avoids coherence errors.
