## Stage 2 — Upgraded YAML Card
```yaml
front: "In an interference-with-goods problem, how do you classify trespass to goods, conversion, and detinue, and select the correct remedy (valuation dates, return orders, detention damages)?"
back: |
  Issue. Which interference-with-goods tort applies and what remedy follows?

  Rule. Trespass to goods protects possession against direct interference and is actionable per se (Hutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131, 132–133). Conversion requires an intentional dealing with the goods that is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s immediate right to possession, whether by unauthorised dominion or refusal after a proper demand (Penfolds Wines Pty Ltd v Elliott [1946] HCA 46; (1946) 74 CLR 204, 228–230; Bunnings Group Ltd v CHEP Australia Ltd [2011] NSWCA 342; (2011) 82 NSWLR 420, [124]). Detinue is a continuing cause of action: after the plaintiff (with an immediate right) demands return, the defendant’s refusal gives rise to relief by judgment for return or, in the alternative, value at the date of judgment plus damages for detention (Heavener v Loomes [1924] HCA 10; (1924) 34 CLR 306). Damages in conversion are ordinarily the full value at the time of conversion (Butler v Egg & Egg Pulp Marketing Board [1966] HCA 74; (1966) 114 CLR 185, 191–192).

  Application. 1) Title to sue: establish actual possession or an immediate right (consider bailors/bailees—jus tertii rarely assists defendants). 2) Characterise the interference: direct trespass (actionable per se), dominion supporting conversion, or demand-refusal activating detinue. 3) Remedy: trespass yields nominal/compensatory damages; conversion gives substitutionary value as at conversion; detinue allows specific return or, failing that, value at judgment plus detention damages.

  Conclusion. Correct classification governs remedy: trespass protects possession per se; conversion substitutes value at conversion; detinue delivers return or judgment-value with detention damages because the wrong continues until compliance.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS exams reward precise sequencing: stand up your possessory title first, then choose between trespass (direct interference), conversion (dominion inconsistent with immediate right), and detinue (demand/refusal). Each tort drives a different remedy—especially the valuation dates and detention damages. Mislabel the tort and you misstate the relief, losing marks. Bunnings ensures you remember demand/refusal can evidence conversion, while Heavener explains why detinue’s valuation waits until judgment. Keep the jus tertii rule and bailment standing in view to secure high-band answers.
mnemonic: "TCD-J → Title → Characterise → Date (conversion vs judgment) → Jus tertii rarely helps defendants."

tripwires:
  - Pleading conversion where the interference was merely negligent loss or misdelivery.
  - Omitting a clear demand/refusal before alleging detinue.
  - Using the wrong valuation date (detinue ≠ conversion).
  - Assuming legal ownership is required when possessory title suffices.
  - Arguing jus tertii to defeat a plaintiff with the better possessory right.

## Notes
- Two-source verification standardised to AustLII + Jade.io (or NSW Caselaw for NSWLR decisions).
- Butler neutral citation updated to [1966] HCA 74 to maintain AGLC4 compliance.
- Jus tertii limitation added to mnemonic/tripwires per red-team feedback.
- Further pinpoint verification for Heavener and Bunnings flagged for manual follow-up when authorised reports accessible.
