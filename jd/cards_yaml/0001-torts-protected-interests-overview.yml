front: In an exam scenario, how would you identify, classify, and apply the three
  protected interests in tort law (personal injury, property, pure economic loss),
  linking each to its leading case, framework, and treatment of defences and damages
  under Victorian law?
back: 'Tort law protects three principal interests, each grounded in distinct doctrinal
  frameworks, statutory overlays, and policy concerns.


  1. Personal Injury/Physical Harm

  Rooted in the neighbour principle from Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562 (HL),
  this category covers both intentional torts (battery, assault, false imprisonment)
  and negligence. The High Court has refined duty–breach through Rogers v Whitaker
  (1992) 175 CLR 479 (disclosure of material risk) and Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106
  CLR 112 (foreseeability). Mental harm is constrained by Sullivan v Moody (2001)
  207 CLR 562 and Tame v New South Wales (2002) 211 CLR 317. Statutory framework:
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 43–48 (duty/breach), s 51 (causation), s 26 (contributory
  negligence). Defences include contributory negligence and volenti. Damages are compensatory,
  subject to non-economic loss thresholds and caps in Pt VBA (see s 28G).


  2. Property Damage/Interference

  Protection flows from the principle of exclusive possession in Entick v Carrington
  (1765) 19 St Tr 1029. Causes of action include trespass to land or goods, conversion,
  and private nuisance. Foreseeability and remoteness are governed by Overseas Tankship
  (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock & Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound No 1) [1961] AC 388
  (PC). Duties may be limited where third-party acts intervene, e.g. Modbury Triangle
  Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil (2000) 205 CLR 254. Defences include lawful authority
  and statutory justification. Remedies emphasise restoration, typically damages or
  injunctions.


  3. Pure Economic Loss

  Courts apply the salient features test from Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR
  180, focusing on vulnerability, control, and coherence. Key cases: Caltex Oil (Australia)
  Pty Ltd v The Dredge “Willemstad” (1976) 136 CLR 529, Woolcock Street Investments
  Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 515, Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners Corporation
  Strata Plan 61288 (2014) 254 CLR 185. Relational economic loss is generally unrecoverable.
  Misleading conduct under the Australian Consumer Law (Competition and Consumer Act
  2010 (Cth) sch 2, esp. s 18 and s 236) may provide statutory relief. Damages are
  confined to foreseeable, determinate losses.


  Across all interests, classification determines which duty/breach framework applies,
  what defences are open, and how damages are assessed. Personal injury attracts broadest
  protection, property claims hinge on possession and foreseeability, while pure economic
  loss is most restricted by policy.

  '
why_it_matters: 'In MLS exams, rapid classification of the interest at stake drives
  the entire answer. Personal injury triggers broad neighbour-based duties, property
  damage invokes possession and foreseeability, and economic loss demands salient
  features analysis. Fact patterns often blend categories (e.g. psychiatric harm with
  economic fallout), requiring triage: identify the primary interest, flag overlaps,
  and apply the stricter test to avoid over-claiming. H1 answers show sequencing—first
  duty existence, then narrowing scope via policy (coherence in psychiatric harm,
  indeterminacy in economic loss). Citing Wrongs Act pinpoints (ss 43–48, 51; Pt VBA)
  and ACL remedies signals statutory sophistication. The differentiator is fluency
  in pivoting between categories under time pressure, showing not just the doctrinal
  test but also policy rationale and strategy.

tripwires:
- Confusing pure economic loss with consequential economic loss
- Ignoring Wrongs Act statutory caps and thresholds in Pt VBA
- Misstating salient features as elements rather than policy controls
- Overlooking psychiatric harm limits under Sullivan v Moody and Tame v NSW
- Treating relational economic loss as recoverable when generally excluded
- Forgetting that trespass protects possession, not ownership
