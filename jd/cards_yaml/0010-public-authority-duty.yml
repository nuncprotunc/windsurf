front: When will a Victorian court recognise a negligence duty against a public authority?
back: 'Issue.

  When a plaintiff sues a public authority, should a private-law duty of care be recognised?

  Rule.

  Foreseeability is necessary but not sufficient.

  duty turns on salient features filtered through institutional and statutory coherence.

  Application scaffold.

  **Statutory coherence gate**: identify the governing scheme’s purpose and preconditions
  (e.g.

  detention powers) .

  Hunter and New England Local Health District v McKenna [2014] HCA 44.

  (2014) 253 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 270, 279-284
  [17]-[40].

  Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra [2009] HCA 15.

  (2009) 237 CLR 215, 230-236 [43]-[81].

  Authorities map.

  Statutory hook.

  Tripwires.

  Conclusion.

  There is no general governmental rescue duty.

  recognition is most likely where the authority undertook a specific operational
  function, exercised control with knowledge in circumstances of reliance or vulnerability,
  and coherence with statutory purpose Exam tip: sequence issues -> rules -> application
  -> conclusion; cite a lead authority and the operative section.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  Lead: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562.

  __HD__3__

  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.

  __HD__4__

  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps

  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

  __HD__5__

  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: "MLS examiners regularly frame hypotheticals around councils, police\n\
  \  or health agencies whose regulatory or discretionary decisions allegedly caused\n\
  \  harm. This card supplies an IRAC gateway: (1) coherence with the empowering legislation\n\
  \  (including Mental Health Act 1986 (Vic) s 10(1), Migration Act 1958 (Cth) s 198AHA,\n\
  \  and Charter ss 7, 21, 38), (2) policy versus operational character (filtering,\
  \ not\n  immunity), (3) salient features (control, knowledge, reliance, vulnerability,\
  \ indeterminacy),\n  and (4) Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XII (ss 79, 82–85). It prevents\
  \ frequent errors:\n  assuming a standing governmental duty to prevent third-party\
  \ harm, conflating merits\n  review with negligence, or ignoring resource-allocation\
  \ provisions and rights-balancing\n  obligations. The pinpoint citations let you\
  \ drop authoritative lines from Sullivan\n  v Moody, Barclay Oysters, McKenna, Kirkland-Veenstra,\
  \ Pyrenees, Crimmins and Brodie\n  under time pressure. Policy tensions—coherence,\
  \ separation of powers, defensive\n  administration, and Charter compliance—are\
  \ foregrounded so you can argue why recognising\n  (or denying) duty aligns with\
  \ statutory purpose. Use the mnemonic and mindmap to\n  triage: if statutory coherence\
  \ fails, stop; if the conduct is purely policy, duty\n  is unlikely; if operational\
  \ with strong salient features and no statutory conflict,\n  press on to breach,\
  \ causation, damage and defences.\n\n  \n"
mnemonic: POLAR-CC → Policy vs Operational → Legal coherence → Assumption/Responsibility
→ Reliance/Vulnerability → Control → Charter & causation handoff: {}

  filter.
