# 0010-public-authority-duty.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Policy/operational distinction is not an immunity.
2. No general rescue duty exists for public authorities.
3. Statutory purpose/resource limits must be considered.
4. Charter coherence is essential before duty extension.

### Rationale
- Commonly misinterpreted as blanket immunity.
- Students often assume a duty exists to prevent harm.
- Failure to consider limits leads to flawed duty arguments.
- Ignoring Charter coherence can result in incorrect duty recognition.

root((Public authority duty — Vic))
  A. Issue
    Duty of care recognition
  B. Rule
    Foreseeability necessary, not sufficient
    Salient features + coherence (no blanket immunity)
    Policy/operational = filter, not defence
  C. Application
    Read empowering statute; purpose/limits
    Control/assumption • reliance/vulnerability • indeterminacy
  D. Authorities
    Sullivan v Moody
    Pyrenees Shire Council v Day
    Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra
  E. Statutes
    Wrongs Act ss 83–85; s 48
    Charter ss 7, 21, 38 (coherence)
