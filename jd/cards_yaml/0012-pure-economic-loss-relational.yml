front: "Relational pure economic loss (Vic): when does a duty arise for business shutdowns\n\
  \  or third-party property damage?\n"
back: 'Issue.

  Has D assumed a duty to protect P from pure economic loss suffered relationally
  (e.g., business losses when a utility shuts down or third-party property is damaged)?

  __HD__0__

  Relational pure economic loss duties are exceptional.

  Apply the salient-features methodology (Perre v Apand (1999) 198 Commonwealth Law
  Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 180 at 192 [4]-[5], 253 [198].

  Caltex Refineries v Stavar [2009] New South Wales Court of Appeal (NSWCA) 258 at
  [102]-[103]) as a framework, not a checklist.

  __HD__1__

  1) Classify the harm: pure (no physical injury) or consequential.

  2) Apply salient features test contextually, avoiding a tick-box approach.

  __HD__2__

  Core framework: Perre v Apand 198 CLR 180.

  Caltex Refineries v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258.

  Commercial vulnerability: Woolcock [2004] HCA 16.

  Brookfield [2014] HCA 36.

  Statutory coherence: Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59.

  __HD__3__

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt Proportionate Liability Part (Pt Part IVAA (proportionate
  liability) (IVAA)) (proportionate liability).

  Australian Consumer Law (Australian Consumer Law (ACL)) (Cth) ss 18, 236 (misleading
  conduct, damages).

  __HD__4__

  Treating foreseeability as sufficient without analysing salient features.

  Assuming all utility customers form a determinate class.

  Ignoring vulnerability analysis in commercial contexts.

  Overlooking Pt IVAA apportionment with ACL claims.

  __HD__5__

  Duty arises only where D knew/ought to have known of a vulnerable, determinate plaintiff/class
  who could not self-protect, and recognition is coherent with contractual/statutory
  allocations.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

  Lead: Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180, 192 [4]–[5], 253 [198].

why_it_matters: "MLS exams test your ability to move beyond foreseeability and apply\n\
  \  the salient-features framework rigorously. Strong answers distinguish targeted\
  \ plaintiffs\n  from diffuse classes, integrate vulnerability analysis, and address\
  \ statutory overlays\n  (Pt IVAA, ACL). Examiners look for precise application to\
  \ fact patterns (e.g., utility\n  shutdowns, building defects) and explicit policy\
  \ reasoning.\n\n  \n"

tripwires:
- Treating foreseeability as sufficient without salient features analysis.
- Assuming all utility customers form a determinate class.
- Ignoring vulnerability analysis in commercial contexts.
- Overlooking Pt IVAA apportionment with ACL claims.
- Pleading ACL s 18 without trade/commerce and causation.
- Ignoring coherence constraints from Sullivan v Moody.
