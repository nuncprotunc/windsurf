The prospective nature of the inquiry as to breach has particular significance in the case of the risk of psychiatric injury.  In any organisation, including in employer/employee relationshi
ps, situations creating stress will arise.  Indeed, some form of tension may be endemic in any form of hierarchy.  The law of tort does not require every employer to have procedures to ensure that such relationships do not lead to psychological distress o
f its employees.  There is no breach of duty unless a situation can be seen to arise which requires intervention on a test of reasonableness.

Nationwide News contended that the trial judge erred in finding that it was just and reasonable to extend the limitation period.  Both at trial and on appeal, it relied on the loss of Mr Chaloner\rquote

.  I will deal with the test
 under s 151D later in these reasons.  In determining that question, his Honour first looked at the question of delay.  His Honour observed that the first complaint suggestive of psychiatric injury was made on 30 May 1997 to Dr Phadke, Mr Naidu\rquote 
s general practitioner.  Mr Naidu was then referred to Dr Butler, Consultant Psychiatrist, by Dr Phadke and had four consultations with Dr Butler between 6 and 23 June 1997.  Dr Butler diagnosed that Mr Naidu was suffering from \'93}{

r affairs on the basis that once claims had expired, their potential liability had come to an end; the public interest in the rapid settlement of disputes;  and the fact that the legislature had recognised that there were cases where it was just and reaso

viewed above, as well as the fact that Mr Naidu\rquote s claim arose out of the conduct of Mr Chaloner, who was a senior employee of Nationwide News and who had the actual day-to-day supervision of Mr Naidu, to ISS Security\rquote

The actual prejudice of which Nationwide News complained was the loss of the file on Mr Chaloner.  The file was not a contemporaneous file compiled either by or in respect of Mr Chaloner, nor was it a general employment file.  R
ather, it was a file put together by Ms McDiarmid, following the sexual assault allegations.  Ms McDiarmid subsequently left her employment with Nationwide News.  There was no evidence of what material was on the file or likely to be on the file.  Senior 
counsel for Nationwide News submitted that there may have been material on the file which would explain the knowledge, or lack of knowledge, on the part of Nationwide News as to Mr Chaloner\rquote

 not available for emotional distress.  In this case the evidence clearly established that Mr Naidu suffered a recognisable psychiatric injury.

It is necessary at this point, therefore, to consider the position and authority of Mr Chaloner within Nationwide News.  As I have said, he was the Fire and Safety Officer.  He directly reported to Mr Pain
e.  Whilst Mr Chaloner was not said to be the next most senior manager below him, the fact that he reported to Mr Paine does indicate his high level of seniority in the organisation.  More importantly, however, was the nature of his management role.  He w
as in charge of all Nationwide News\rquote  security requirements, Australia-wide.  His Honour accepted Mr Blinkworth\rquote s evidence that Mr Chaloner did not have the power to cancel ISS Security\rquote 
s contract with Nationwide News.  Mr Blinkworth said that decisions of t
hat nature were made at director level.  However, Mr Chaloner was responsible for negotiating salary levels and the security operations that were provided to Nationwide News and for managing the contracts with ISS Security.

When that position is reached, the question of reasonable foreseeability for the purposes of establishing the existence of a duty of care, resolves itself in this case fairly readily.  Nationwide News,
 as embodied by Mr Chaloner, perpetrated conduct on Mr Naidu that was prolonged, abusive, intimidating and physically threatening.  It was bullying in an extreme form.  Bullying has been described in a different context as a \'93}{
\i\f0\fs20\cf1\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 serious and insidious form of violence}{\f0\fs20\cf1\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 \'94:  see Elvin, J, \'93The duty of schools to prevent bullying\'94,}{\i\f0\fs20\cf1\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033  }{

 he was observed by others at the workplace to change over a period of time from a happy person to one who appeared depressed.  Accordingly, this was not a case like }{\i\f0\fs20\cf1\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Limited }{

Where acts of physical violence are concerned, the nature and seriousness of the criminal act may be relevant to a judgment as to whether it is to be regarded as a personal, independent act of the perpetrator, or whether it is wit
hin the scope of employment. A security guard at business premises who removes a person with unnecessary force may be acting in the course of employment. On the other hand, as Jordan CJ pointed out in }{\i\f0\fs20\cf1\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

e, perhaps combined with other factors, such as personal animosity towards the victim, might lead to a conclusion that what is involved is an act of purely personal vindictiveness. Sexual abuse, which is so obviously inconsistent with the responsibilities
 
of anyone involved with the instruction and care of children, in former times would readily have been regarded as conduct of a personal and independent nature, unlikely ever to be treated as within the course of employment. Yet such conduct might take dif
f
erent forms. An opportunistic act of serious and random violence might be different, in terms of its connection with employment, from improper touching by a person whose duties involve intimate contact with another. In recent years, in most common law jur
isdictions, courts have had to deal with a variety of situations involving sexual abuse by employees.\'94

The question whether the risk of psychiatric harm to Mr Naidu was reasonably foreseeable so far as ISS Security was concerned raises different considerations
 to those relevant to Nationwide News.  I have already adverted to this above.  His Honour found that ISS Security had no knowledge of Mr Chaloner\rquote 
s racial discrimination towards Mr Naidu.  His Honour found, however, that Mr Naidu complained about Mr Chaloner being difficult, demanding, and more relevantly, unreasonable (judgment [159]).

s complaints to Mr Blinkworth were not sufficient to lead any reasonable person to apprehend the risk o
f psychiatric injury and although he had not witnessed any misconduct, Mr Blinkworth was well aware that Mr Chaloner was a bully. His Honour considered, therefore, that Mr Blinkworth would, or should, have realised that Mr Chaloner frequently used, at lea

s conduct, including that it was of an intimidatory nature, and that Mr Naidu was the butt of it (judgment 191).  His Honour made references to other issues in this finding.  However, the effect of this finding is that the combination of Mr Naidu\rquote 
s complaints and Mr Blinkworth\rquote s own knowledge were such that it should have been reasonably foreseeable to Mr Blinkworth that Mr Chaloner\rquote s intimidatory conduct over a protracted period could cause psychiatric harm.

erformed.  Rather, it was a sophisticated \lquote white collar\rquote  workplace.  The meaning and content of an implied term such as \'93}{\i\f0\fs20\cf1\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 safe place}{\f0\fs20\cf1\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 \'94 and \'93

use is unlawful, and in a modern society bullying and intimidation are recognised as improper forms of conduct.  Those factors also give content to the meaning of these terms.

a

The essential attack made upon this award is that the distress, humiliation and the like suffered as a result of breach of contract, had in fact been subsumed in the award of damages for psychiatric injury itself.  It was subm
itted that there was, therefore, no loss flowing discretely from the breach of contract.  Although the submission was not precisely in these terms, the effect of it was that there had been double compensation.  In my opinion, this argument on its face has
 merit.  In order to see whether it ought to be sustained, it is necessary to know what was encompassed in the award of general damages arising from the claims in negligence and intentional torts.

his mental health caused during a period of years when he was placed by his employer, a security firm, at premises operated by Nationwide News Pty Ltd (\'93Nationwide News\'94

incorrectly named as News Limited\'94.  In due course it filed a notice of appeal without appointment, but when filing a notice of appeal with appointment and an amended notice of appeal, the company described itself as \'93Nationwide News Ltd\'94

 extraordinary that, the intention of Mr Chaloner being as I have characterised it, he would not be liable for the actual injury he inflicted on the plaintiff, though he had not actually thought that what he was doing might do more than cause temporary, t

ough acute and painful distress.  In fact, I consider that Mr Chaloner was indifferent to the consequences of his malice and was content to cause as much distress as his actions were capable of inflicting, subject, I suppose, to the desirability of the pl

he first part of this passage in the reasoning of the trial judge appears to be concerned with the potential liability of Mr Chaloner, although he was not a party to the proceedings.  The final sentence, refers to Nationwide and ISS Security being liable

His Honour dealt with the liability of Nationwide News at [202]-[225].  His Honour commenced with the proposition that Mr Paine, as Mr Chaloner\rquote s superior at Nationwide News, was aware of Mr Chaloner\rquote 
s misconduct on the basis of a report from another Nationwide News employee, Mr Kamaledine, in June 1995, and long before the dismissal of Mr Chaloner in November 1996.  However, his Honour then diverted to
 a question of vicarious liability for intentional acts of Mr Chaloner before returning at [225] to deal with the question of knowledge in the following terms:

In the intervening paragraphs, the trial judge dealt explicitly with the liability of Nationwide News for intentional misconduct on the part of Mr Chaloner.  His Honour concluded that part at least of Mr Chaloner\rquote 
s conduct was sufficiently closely connected to his duties as an employee of Nationwide News to be characterised as the exercise of his authority in the course of his employment, though by an improper and unauthorised mode.  Accordingly, he concluded that
 Nationwide was vicariously liable for misconduct so characterised: at [224].

.  Despite the reference to \'93personal liability\'94
, very little in the written submissions on the appeal addressed a form of direct, as opposed to vicarious, liability on the part of Nationwide News.  Such a form of liability would require a finding as to Mr Chaloner\rquote s status as the
 alter ego of the company.  The reference to direct liability of the company in the plaintiff\rquote 
s written submissions on the appeal (p 3, 23, 35 and 36) presented no substantial argument as to the basis for such a conclusion.  Nor was the matter significantl
y advanced in oral argument, although counsel for Nationwide News took no exception to the suggestion that it might be liable on that basis (Appeal Tcpt, 30/07/07, pp 23(25)) and counsel for the plaintiff confirmed that he sought to pursue that basis of l
i
ability: Tcpt, 31/07/07, p 25(40).  Although, as demonstrated by other members of the Court, there may be strong reasons for an affirmative finding in that regard, I would prefer not to decide the appeal on that basis.  To determine whether a finding of v
icarious liability was correctly made it is necessary to consider whether those aspects of the conduct of Mr Chaloner for which Nationwide News is to be held responsible give rise to the relevant tortious liability.

\rquote s private concerns.  However, although the other elements of his conduct no doubt fed his own ego and sense of importance and power (that is, were personally gratifying) they were also ways by
 which he controlled the plaintiff in the actual performance of his employment.  They had the effect of ensuring his almost unprotesting compliance with Mr Chaloner[\rquote

ISS Security had a contract with Nationwide News pursuant to which it provided security services.  No contract was in evidence, but correspondence between the parties in mid-1997, in relation to a number of disputed payments, suggested that the

, implying that previously there had been inadequate documentation of the contractual arrangements.  There was also, apparently, no written contract between the plaintiff and ISS Security, he having been asked to sign a sala

First, his Honour approached the matter on the basis that a senior officer of ISS Security, Mr Blinkworth, must have had sufficient information in relation to Mr Chaloner\rquote s conduc
t to put him on notice that the plaintiff was at risk, thereby engaging an obligation to investigate further.  However, at [189] his Honour concluded that Mr Blinkworth was on notice only of Mr Chaloner\rquote s \'93unreasonable demands\'94

This line of reasoning, however, provided little assistance to the plaintiff who did not say that he was dissuaded or discouraged from complaining, but rather that he complained repeatedly, evidence which was rejected by the trial judge.

t
he Chief Justice explains, it is not possible to treat the knowledge of junior employees, who were either subordinate to or at best of equal status to the plaintiff, as knowledge of the company: at [44] above.  To treat their knowledge as, constructively,
 
knowledge of the company would require consideration of the circumstances in which the company was obliged to have a policy requiring junior members of staff to report unreasonable demands of supervisory staff at Nationwide News.  If they were not as seri
