front: How do you apply the Shirt calculus to determine breach in negligence?
back: 'Issue. Identify when a defendant falls below the reasonable-response standard
  under Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 once duty is already established. Rule. The Shirt
  calculus asks whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions by weighing:
  (1) foreseeability (not far‑fetched or fanciful) (Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR
  112, 121; s 48(1)(a)); (2) not insignificant risk (s 48(1)(b)); (3) probability
  and seriousness of harm; (4) burden of precautions; and (5) social utility (s 48(2)(a)–(d);
  Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40, 47–48). The precise mode of injury
  need not be foreseeable (Vairy v Wyong (2005) 223 CLR 422). Contributory negligence
  (CN) analysis is separate but informed by the same balance (Podrebersek v Australian
  Iron & Steel (1985) 59 ALJR 492, 494). Application scaffold. 1) Frame the specific
  risk without hindsight (s 49). 2) Establish foreseeability and “not insignificant”
  risk (s 48(1)(a)–(b)). 3) Evaluate s 48(2)(a)–(d): probability, seriousness, burden,
  social utility — cite fact anchors (public authority, recreation, vulnerable plaintiff).
  4) Address overlays: s 50 warnings, ss 53–56 obvious and inherent risk provisions
  (explain why volenti does/does not arise). 5) Conclude on breach, then hand off
  to causation under s 51 and any CN apportionment. Authorities map. Threshold and
  balancing: Wyong v Shirt 146 CLR 40, 47–48; Wrongs Act s 48(1)–(2). Foreseeability:
  Chapman 106 CLR 112, 121; Vairy 223 CLR 422. Probability/seriousness nuance (UK
  illustration of low-probability tolerance): Bolton v Stone [1951] AC 850, 860; Paris
  v Stepney [1951] AC 367, 382. Burden/proportionality: Latimer v AEC Ltd [1953] AC
  643, 653 (UK nuance on “reasonably practicable”). Policy/public authority calibration:
  Brodie v Singleton Shire Council (2001) 206 CLR 512. Inference and separation from
  causation: Strong v Woolworths Ltd (2012) 246 CLR 182, 189 [23]. CN interplay: Podrebersek
  59 ALJR 492, 494. Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48–49, 51. Conclusion.
  Breach is established only if the s 48 balance shows a reasonable person would have
  taken additional precautions; keep causation and CN in their own steps.

why_it_matters: 'This is the core exam scaffold for breach. Starting at s 48(1) forces
  precise risk identification and the “not insignificant” screen; s 48(2) then structures
  a proportional response to probability, seriousness, burden, and social utility,
  with s 49–56 guardrails. Separating breach from causation (s 51) and CN earns method
  marks.

tripwires:
- Treating foreseeability alone as breach without proving “not insignificant” (s 48(1)).
- Framing the risk with hindsight rather than ex ante (s 49 guardrail).
- Reducing s 48(2) to a checklist instead of a balancing exercise.
- Over‑relying on “obvious risk” where D’s operations created the hazard.
- Collapsing breach with causation instead of applying s 51 separately.
