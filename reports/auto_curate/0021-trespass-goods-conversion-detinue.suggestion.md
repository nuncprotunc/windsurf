# 0021-trespass-goods-conversion-detinue.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Don't confuse trespass with conversion.
2. Avoid misapplying the jus tertii rule.
3. Don't overlook the need for actual possession.
4. Ensure correct valuation timing for detinue.

### Rationale
- Confusing trespass with conversion can lead to incorrect remedy application.
- Misapplying the jus tertii rule can weaken a defendant's position.
- Neglecting actual possession undermines the title to sue.
- Incorrect valuation timing for detinue can misstate the relief.
