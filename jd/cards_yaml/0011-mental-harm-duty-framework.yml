front: 'Mental harm duties (Vic): how do Wrongs Act Pt XI filters apply to rescuers,
  secondary victims, and workplace trauma?'
back: 'Issue. When does the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI impose a duty to avoid mental
  harm in rescuers, secondary victims, or workplace trauma scenarios?


  Rule. Part XI applies only to negligence (s 72(1)); intentional torts and breach
  of statutory duty sit outside. “Mental harm” covers both pure and consequential
  mental harm (s 72). Duty for pure mental harm arises only if a person of normal
  fortitude might suffer a recognised psychiatric illness in the circumstances if
  reasonable care was not taken (s 72(1)), guided by factors in s 72(2) (nature of
  the event, relationship, presence, prior dealings). Shock-based claims are further
  limited by s 73(1)–(3) (scene/relationship requirement, derivative claims). Damages
  for any mental harm require proof of a recognised psychiatric illness (ss 74–75).
  The High Court rejects rigid control mechanisms—foreseeability is the touchstone
  (Tame v NSW; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317, 379 [185]).
  Rescuers can recover if they perceive victims being put in peril (Wicks v State
  Rail Authority of NSW (2010) 241 CLR 60, 76–77 [44]–[52]); textual differences matter
  (cf King v Philcox (2015) 255 CLR 304). Workplace psychiatric duties turn on foreseeability
  and systems response (Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd (2005) 222 CLR 44; Kozarov
  v Victoria [2022] HCA 12).


  Application scaffold. 1) Classify harm: pure (no physical injury) or consequential
  (flowing from physical injury). 2) For pure harm, apply s 72(1) normal-fortitude
  foreseeability with s 72(2) factors. 3) Check s 73(1)–(2) scene/relationship limits
  for shock-based claims; confirm derivative bar s 73(3). 4) Confirm recognised psychiatric
  illness and medical evidence (ss 74–75; Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 79). 5) Assess
  fact patterns: rescuers (Wicks), secondary victims (Jaensch; Gifford; King), workplace
  trauma (Koehler; Kozarov). 6) Note procedural steps: Wrongs Act s 64 pre-trial notice
  for psychiatric injury. 7) If duty passes filters, continue to breach (s 48), causation
  (s 51) and defences (eg, contributory negligence).


  Authorities map. Filters: Tame/Annetts 211 CLR 317; Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155
  CLR 549; Gifford v Strang Patrick (2003) 214 CLR 269. Rescuers: Wicks 241 CLR 60.
  Statutory wording limits: King v Philcox 255 CLR 304. Workplace psychiatric duty:
  Koehler 222 CLR 44; Kozarov [2022] HCA 12. Notice/diagnosis: Evidence Act s 79;
  Wrongs Act s 64.


  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (ss 72–75, s 64); Wrongs Act ss 48,
  51 (for breach/causation after duty); Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 79.


  Tripwires. Treating “normal fortitude” as a plaintiff attribute rather than a foreseeability
  filter. Reintroducing discredited “sudden shock” control mechanisms apart from the
  s 72(2) factors. Ignoring s 73 scene/relationship limits for shock-based pure mental
  harm. Relying on Koehler to deny duty in high-risk workplaces contrary to Kozarov.
  Claiming grief/anxiety without a recognised psychiatric illness and expert support.


  Conclusion. Only plaintiffs who satisfy Pt XI filters and prove a recognised psychiatric
  illness engage a duty; consequential harm then follows ordinary negligence analysis,
  and pure mental harm hinges on statutory compliance before breach/cause/damages.

why_it_matters: 'MLS exams often pivot on Pt XI. Fast classification, s 72–75 pinpoints,
  expert evidence, and Wrongs Act s 64 notice show statutory literacy and keep you
  from reviving outlawed “shock” tests. The scaffold balances the floodgates concern
  with compensation for foreseeable psychiatric injury.

tripwires:
- Treating normal fortitude as a plaintiff attribute instead of a foreseeability test.
- Requiring sudden shock or direct perception beyond s 72(2).
- Skipping s 73(1)–(2) scene/relationship limits.
- Extending Koehler to class-risk workplaces despite Kozarov.
- Claiming damages without a recognised psychiatric illness or expert diagnosis.
