front: How do courts distinguish the existence of a duty of care from its scope, and
how should you apply that distinction in a Victorian negligence problem?: {}
back: 'Issue.

  Separate duty existence from scope so Victorian negligence stays sequenced before
  breach or causation.

  Rule.

  Existence turns on foreseeability filtered by salient features and coherence (Sullivan
  v Moody.

  Perre.

  Woolcock).

  Graham Barclay Oysters ties public authorities to statutory purpose, while Crimmins,
  Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra, and Tame/Annetts show omissions or psychiatric harm
  demand control or assumed responsibility.

  Application scaffold.

  1) Existence: map foreseeability, salient features, and coherence before naming
  duty.

  2) If satisfied, define scope by isolating the risk, actors, and setting.

  3) Analyse breach via Wrongs Act s 48, then causation/scope under s 51 with interveners.

  Authorities map.

  Statutory hook.

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 26, 48, 51, 54.

  Pt Victorian statutory damages part (Pt Victorian Bar Association (VBA)) caps/thresholds.

  Pt Proportionate Liability Part (Pt Part IVAA (proportionate liability) (IVAA))
  proportionate liability.

  consider Australian Consumer Law (Australian Consumer Law (ACL)) s 18 for concurrent
  statutory claims.

  Tripwires.

  Avoid importing the Shirt calculus into existence, collapsing scope into s 51, or
  skipping coherence checks.

  keep psychiatric-harm and omission gates tight.

  Conclusion.

  Sequence existence -> scope -> breach -> causation -> remedy to show doctrinal discipline
  and statutory literacy.

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

tripwires:
- Conflating existence with scope instead of treating sequentially.
- Importing the Shirt breach calculus into the duty inquiry.
- Ignoring omissions or psychiatric-harm limits when framing existence.
- Failing to anchor statutory defences (s 54) or damages caps (Pt VBA) once duty is
  found.
