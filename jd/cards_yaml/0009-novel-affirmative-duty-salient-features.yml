front: In a novel or affirmative-duty scenario (incl public authorities), how do you
decide if a duty of care should be recognised under Victorian law?: {}
back: 'Issue.

  When facts fall outside settled categories (often involving omissions or public
  authorities), should a new duty of care be recognised consistent with Victorian
  law?

  __HD__0__

  Apply the salient-features approach (Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009]
  New South Wales Court of Appeal (NSWCA) 258.

  (2009) 75 New South Wales Law Reports (NSWLR) 649, [103]).

  foreseeability is necessary but insufficient.

  __HD__1__

  1) Recognised category?

  If the scenario fits an established duty (eg, teacher-student once authority assumed:
  Geyer v Downs (1977) 138 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR))
  91), apply that framework.

  Salient features: Stavar 75 NSWLR 649, [103].

  Coherence constraints: Sullivan v Moody 207 CLR 562, [42].

  Treating foreseeability as sufficient for duty.

  Checklist-dumping all Stavar factors without identifying the decisive ones.

  Conflating the duty analysis with breach under s 48.

  Imposing affirmative duties on authorities absent control or statutory preconditions.

  __HD__4__

  Deliver a factor-by-factor justification showing why duty should (or should not)
  be recognised, then address breach, causation and damages sequentially.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps

  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss

  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.

why_it_matters: "MLS problems often hinge on novel or omissions duty. Markers reward:\n\
  \  (1) sequencing (recognised category → salient features → coherence), (2) a public-authority\n\
  \  discipline pass (Wrongs Act ss 83–85), and (3) clean separation of duty from\
  \ breach\n  (s 48), causation and damages. Use factor signposts as paragraph headings\
  \ and justify\n  why particular features decide these facts (do not checklist Stavar).\
  \ Policy levers\n  to mention: indeterminacy/floodgates, autonomy (no general rescue\
  \ duty), statutory\n  purpose and resources (coherence), and over-deterrence if\
  \ courts impose broad affirmative\n  duties. Tie reliance/assumption questions to\
  \ ACL s 18 to show awareness of statutory\n  remedies and potential duplication/conflict.\
  \ If you apply this scaffold in 10–12\n  minutes, you will give a principled yes/no\
  \ on duty and bank H1-level structure.\n"
