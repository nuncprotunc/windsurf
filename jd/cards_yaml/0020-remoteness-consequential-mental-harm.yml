front: 'Consequential mental harm (Vic): is psychiatric injury too remote?'
back: 'Issue. Whether the plaintiff’s psychiatric injury is within the scope of liability
  or too remote when it follows another injury. Note: Original front overflow — “Remoteness
  & consequential mental harm: In a negligence problem, how do you assess whether
  psychiatric injury is too remote where the plaintiff’s mental harm follows another
  injury (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 74)?”


  Rule. Remoteness confines liability to reasonably foreseeable kinds of harm; the
  exact mechanism or magnitude need not be foreseen (Overseas Tankship (The Wagon
  Mound No 1) [1961] AC 388 (PC); Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837; Chapman v
  Hearse [1961] HCA 46; (1961) 106 CLR 112). Part XI overlays statutory requirements.
  Section 67 defines “mental harm” and “recognised psychiatric illness”. Section 74(1)(a)–(b),
  with s 74(2), permits recovery for consequential mental harm only where a person
  of normal fortitude might, in the circumstances (including the initial injury),
  suffer an RPI, or the defendant knew of the plaintiff’s susceptibility. The High
  Court rejects rigid “sudden shock” or direct perception limits (Tame v NSW; Annetts
  v Australian Stations [2002] HCA 35; (2002) 211 CLR 317) and accepts aftermath liability
  where the injury forms part of the circumstances (Jaensch v Coffey [1984] HCA 52;
  (1984) 155 CLR 549). Once the kind of harm is foreseeable, defendants take plaintiffs
  as found (Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey [1970] HCA 60; (1970) 125 CLR 383).


  Application scaffold. 1) Characterise the harm as an RPI under s 67. 2) Confirm
  it is consequential on another injury (s 67). 3) Apply s 74(1)(a)–(b) normal‑fortitude
  filter (plus known susceptibility) with s 74(2)’s circumstances. 4) Test remoteness:
  was psychiatric illness as a kind foreseeable? Distinguish thin skull (extent) from
  unforeseeable kind. 5) If foreseeability is satisfied, integrate loss‑allocation/policy
  arguments.


  Conclusion. Consequential psychiatric injury is recoverable when an RPI of that
  kind was reasonably foreseeable within s 74’s framework; mere distress without RPI
  fails.


  Authorities map. Classification of harm: s 67; RPI requirement: ss 67, 74. Statutory
  filter: s 74(1)–(2). Remoteness kind vs extent: Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR
  112; Overseas Tankship (No 1) [1961] AC 388; Hughes [1963] AC 837. Aftermath and
  anti‑shock: Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549; Tame/Annetts [2002] HCA 35; (2002)
  211 CLR 317. Thin skull once kind foreseeable: Pusey (1970) 125 CLR 383.


  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 67, 74 (context: ss 72–73 for pure mental
  harm).


  Tripwires. Treating grief/worry as RPI. Ignoring s 74(2)’s inclusion of the initial
  injury as part of the circumstances. Importing s 72–73 pure mental harm controls
  into consequential claims. Demanding precise mechanism foreseeability (not required).
  Misusing thin skull to avoid the kind‑of‑harm inquiry.

  '
why_it_matters: 'MLS scope questions turn on whether you run remoteness or the statutory
  mental-harm screen first. Start by classifying the claim: consequential (s 74) versus
  pure (ss 72–73). Cite s 67 to confirm the harm is a recognised psychiatric illness.
  Then apply the normal-fortitude filter and the “circumstances” extension in s 74(2)
  before finishing with remoteness (kind, not extent). Tame/Annetts and Jaensch help
  dislodge old UK “shock” control mechanisms, while Pusey supports thin-skull reasoning
  once the kind is foreseeable. Answers that collapse distress with RPI or demand
  precise mechanism predictions lose marks; sequencing statutory elements with foreseeable-kind
  analysis earns H1 credit.

mnemonic: 'KIND–RPI–FORTITUDE: Kind foreseeable? → Recognised psychiatric illness
  (s 67) → Normal fortitude / known susceptibility (s 74) → Remoteness respects thin
  skull.'

tripwires:
- Treating grief or worry as sufficient without a recognised psychiatric illness.
- Forgetting s 74(2) folds the initial injury into the foreseeability circumstances.
- Applying pure mental harm controls (ss 72–73) to consequential claims.
- Demanding foreseeability of precise mechanism rather than the kind of harm.
- Misusing thin skull to dodge the kind-of-harm inquiry.
