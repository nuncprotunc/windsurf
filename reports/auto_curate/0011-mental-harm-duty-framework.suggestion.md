# 0011-mental-harm-duty-framework.yml — Auto-curated structure

## Tripwires (exactly four)

1. Confusing pure and consequential mental harm.
2. Misapplying s 72(2) factors for foreseeability.
3. Overlooking s 73 requirements for secondary victims.
4. Failing to establish a recognised psychiatric illness.

### Rationale
- Pure vs consequential mental harm is a common confusion in exams.
- Forseeability is critical; misapplication of s 72(2) factors leads to errors.
- s 73 has specific requirements that are often overlooked.
- Recognised psychiatric illness is essential for claims; failure to establish this is a frequent pitfall.
