front: "Mental harm duties (Vic): how do Wrongs Act Pt XI filters apply to rescuers, secondary victims, and workplace trauma?"

  Issue.
  Outline when the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI compels recognition of a duty to avoid mental harm for rescuers, secondary victims, and workplace psychiatric injury.

  Rule.
  Pt XI defines "mental harm" to include both pure and consequential psychiatric injury (s 72). A duty to guard against pure mental harm arises only if a person of normal fortitude would have suffered a recognised psychiatric illness that was reasonably foreseeable, assessed with the s 72(2) factors (relationship, control or assurance, absence of a sudden-shock requirement, and exposure). Consequential mental harm follows once physical injury is actionable. High Court guidance (Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317 at [118]â€“[122]) confirms the focus on foreseeability, a recognised illness, and evidence capable of satisfying Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) s 79.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Classify the harm as pure or consequential mental harm.
  (2) If pure mental harm, apply the s 72(1) normal-fortitude foreseeability test using the s 72(2) factors.
  (3) Apply s 73(1)â€“(2) scene and relationship limits for secondary victims and confirm the derivative-claim bar in s 73(3).
  (4) Rescuers: apply Wicks v State Rail Authority of NSW (2010) 241 CLR 60 at [45]â€“[50] to confirm foreseeability without a sudden-shock requirement.
  (5) Workplace claims: evaluate reasonable foreseeability of psychiatric injury in the actual role context (Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd (2005) 222 CLR 44 at [36]â€“[40]; compare Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377 at [50]â€“[55] (persuasive)); demand admissible psychiatric evidence via Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) s 79 and note secondary-victim duties for close family in employer contexts (Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 269 at [30]â€“[35]).

  Authorities map.
  - Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317 at [118]â€“[122] â€” Foreseeability and normal fortitude; no sudden-shock rule.
  - Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549 at 569â€“572 â€” Secondary-victim parameters.
  - Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 269 at [30]â€“[35] â€” Family secondary duties in employer contexts.
  - Wicks v State Rail Authority of NSW (2010) 241 CLR 60 at [45]â€“[52] â€” Rescuers and absence of sudden-shock gate.
  - Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd (2005) 222 CLR 44 at [36]â€“[40] â€” Workplace psychiatric injury foreseeability.
  - Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377 at [50]â€“[55] (persuasive) â€” Workplace bullying foreseeability.

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (Mental Harm) ss 72â€“75.
  - Wrongs Act ss 48 and 51 (breach and causation once duty is recognised).
  - Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) s 79 (expert evidence gatekeeping).

  Tripwires.
  Recurring pitfalls: pure versus consequential mental harm, misuse of s 72(2) factors, overlooking s 73 limits, and failing to prove a recognised psychiatric illnessâ€”consult the dedicated `tripwires` field for detail.

  Conclusion.
  Duty recognition under Pt XI hinges on foreseeable psychiatric illness to a person of normal fortitude with s 73 limits satisfied; once duty is set, proceed to breach and causation under ss 48 and 51.

why_it_matters: |
  Pt XI questions dominate exam fact patterns on rescuers, secondary victims, and occupational stress. This scaffold forces fast classification, applies the correct statutory foreseeability filter, keeps s 73 limits front of mind, and flags expert-evidence plus derivative-claim traps under time pressure.

        When does Pt XI impose a duty (rescuer / secondary / workplace)?
      Rule
        s 72 definition: pure vs consequential
        Foreseeability: normal fortitude (s 72(1))
        Factors: s 72(2); no sudden-shock rule
      Application
        Classify harm: pure vs consequential

tripwires:
- Confusing pure and consequential mental harm.
- Misapplying s 72(2) factors when testing foreseeability.
- Overlooking s 73 requirements for secondary victims.
- Failing to establish a recognised psychiatric illness.
