front: "Breach — Wrongs Act s 48 checklist: how do you triage foreseeability, precautions, and statutory overlays under exam pressure?"
back: |
  Issue. How should you triage Wrongs Act s 48 breach analysis under exam pressure so that foreseeability, precautions, and statutory overlays are covered systematically?

  Rule. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 requires: (i) a foreseeable risk known or ought to have been known; (ii) the risk must be “not insignificant”; (iii) a reasonable person would have taken precautions; (iv) s 48(2) factors (probability, seriousness, burden, social utility) must be weighed contextually (Wyong v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40; RTA v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330 at [136]). Sections 49–56 add guardrails on hindsight, warnings, and obvious/inherent risk, while ACL s 60 and CCA s 139A can overlay or confine obligations.

  Application scaffold. 1) Frame the risk precisely at the relevant ex ante time-slice (Tapp v ABCRA [2022] HCA 11 at [127]–[129], [150]–[156]). 2) Apply s 48(1): confirm foreseeability and “not insignificant” status (exclude far-fetched/fanciful). 3) Run s 48(2)(a)–(d): probability, seriousness, burden, social utility, factoring public authority or venue realities (Vairy; Romeo; Cole). 4) Check statutory overlays: s 49 anti-hindsight, s 50 warnings/signage, ss 53–56 obvious/inherent risk & volenti. 5) Keep breach separate from causation: apply s 51 scope/factual causation and s 52 burden (Adeels Palace (2009) 239 CLR 420 at 435 [43]). 6) Flag Commonwealth overlays (ACL s 60 due care; CCA s 139A waiver limits) before concluding whether additional precautions were reasonably required.

  Authorities map. Core framework: Wyong v Shirt; Wrongs Act s 48. Risk/time-slice discipline: Tapp [2022] HCA 11. Public authority/recreation: Vairy (2005) 223 CLR 422; Romeo (1998) 192 CLR 431; Cole (2004) 217 CLR 469. Crowd control/causation link: Adeels Palace (2009) 239 CLR 420. Statutory overlays: Wrongs Act ss 49–56; ACL s 60; CCA s 139A.

  Statutory hook. Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48–56; ACL (Cth) s 60; CCA 2010 (Cth) s 139A.

  Tripwires. Treating foreseeability as breach without proving “not insignificant”. Reframing the risk with hindsight instead of ex ante evidence. Treating “obvious risk” as absolute when D heightened the danger. Ignoring public-resource burden in s 48(2)(c). Collapsing breach and causation without applying s 51/s 52. Forgetting ACL/CCA overlays when services or recreational waivers arise.

  Conclusion. A disciplined s 48 checklist demands precise risk characterisation, contextual balancing of the s 48(2) factors, and explicit handling of statutory overlays; only then can you justify whether additional precautions were required or reasonable inaction was defensible.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS scripts lose marks when they cite Shirt but ignore Victorian statutory rails. This checklist forces you to apply s 48(1)–(2) methodically, integrate public authority and recreational authorities, and separate breach from causation while acknowledging ACL/CCA overlays—hallmarks of an H1 answer under pressure.

tripwires:
  - Treating foreseeability as sufficient without satisfying the “not insignificant” test.
  - Reframing the risk with hindsight rather than the ex ante time-slice.
  - Assuming obvious risk defeats liability when D heightened the hazard.
  - Ignoring the burden/social utility factor for public authorities or venues.
  - Blurring breach with causation instead of applying s 51/s 52.
  - Omitting ACL s 60 or misreading CCA s 139A limits.
