front: Under Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), when (and how) is proportionate
  liability engaged, especially with mixed claims and timing/pleading triggers?
back: '**Application and Engagement of Pt IVAA (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic))**

  Applies only to claims for economic loss or property damage arising from a failure
  to take reasonable care (s 24AF). Apportionment is not automatic—defendants ordinarily
  must plead a proportionate liability defence under applicable court rules; there
  is no statutory pleading requirement in Pt IVAA itself.


  Where a claim includes both apportionable (economic loss / property damage) and
  non-apportionable components, only the apportionable component is subject to Pt
  IVAA; non-apportionable claims proceed under joint & several liability. *Hunt &
  Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees Pty Ltd* (2013) 247 CLR 613 at 638 [27]
  (HCA) supports that division.


  **Exclusions & Concurrent Wrongdoers**

  Exclusions are set out in s 24AG (e.g., personal injury). Intentional or fraudulent
  conduct of a defendant is not affected by Pt IVAA (s 24AM). ACL and Corporations
  Act interactions are nuanced: Pt IVAA expressly applies to ACL s 18 (Victorian application)
  via s 24AF(1)(b), while non‑apportionable statutory causes remain outside apportionment
  per apex authority (see Selig).


  Concurrent wrongdoers broadly defined (s 24AH); joinder possible under s 24AL.


  **Settlement, Contribution & Practical Consequences**

  Settlement with one wrongdoer does not extinguish claims against others—subsequent
  actions are permitted (s 24AK), subject to no double recovery. Defendants cannot
  pursue contribution between themselves in relation to an apportionable claim (s
  24AJ). This materially impacts offer/compromise strategy.


  Contributory negligence (s 24AN) remains a separate, sequential defences phase—after
  apportionment assessment.


  **Authoritative Cases & Mixed Statutes**

  *ABN Amro Bank NV v Bathurst Regional Council* (2014) 224 FCR 1 at 58 [114] (Full
  FCA) — deals with mixed statutory/common law claims and how apportionment applies.


  *Hunt & Hunt* (2013) 247 CLR 613 at 638 [27] (broad apportionable scope under Pt
  IVAA).


  *Selig v Wealthsure Pty Ltd* (2015) 255 CLR 661 at 673 [34] (HCA) — confirms ACL
  carve-out and that non-apportionable causes are carved out unless the loss is the
  same.


  *Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd* (2004) 216 CLR 515 at 536 [23]
  (HCA) — duty/scope linkage.


  **Conclusion / Strategy**

  To engage Pt IVAA: identify apportionable components (s 24AF), determine exclusions
  (s 24AG), consider concurrent wrongdoers (s 24AH) and joinder (s 24AL). Pleading
  must be done under the court rules to put apportionment in issue.


  In mixed cause-of-action cases, separate the apportionable parts for liability allocation;
  strategy for discovery, joinder, settlement is key.


  The statutory bar on contribution and failure to join or to plead correctly can
  leave plaintiffs worse off.

why_it_matters: 'Understanding when proportionate liability kicks in (i.e. the engagement
  and mixed‑claim rules) is vital in commercial, negligence, professional liability,
  and statutory claim problems. In exams, marks are often lost by assuming Pt IVAA
  applies to non‑apportionable causes or by failing to plead apportionment under the
  court rules (there is no Pt IVAA statutory pleading). Strategic decisions (settling
  with one defendant, offers of compromise) depend on knowing s 24AK (subsequent actions)
  and s 24AJ (contribution bar). Policy tensions: protecting plaintiffs vs preventing
  unfair burden on one defendant; risk of "empty chair" defendants; procedural fairness
  vs efficiency. Examiners expect clear pinpoints (24AE–24AP map), apex authorities
  (ABN Amro; Selig), and explicit mixed‑claim structure. Getting this right distinguishes
  an H1 answer from merely competent.

tripwires:
- Assuming apportionment applies automatically; failing to plead proportionate liability
  und
- Assuming non-apportionable claims are covered if they arise in same proceeding
- '{''Misstating settlement consequences'': ''it is s 24AK (subsequent actions), not
  s 24AS.''}'
- Mistaking that joint & several liability still applies in all parts
- Ignoring intentional/fraud exclusions or statutory carve-outs (ACL, Corporations
  Act)
- Mixing contributory negligence into apportionment rather than as separate stage
- Misapplying mixed cause-of-action authority (ABN Amro vs Selig conflict)
