## Stage 2 — Upgraded YAML Card
```yaml
front: "In a professional negligence problem, how do you apply Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 57–60 to classify the standard of care and assess any peer professional opinion defence?"
back: |
  Issue. Does the defendant meet the Division 5 professional standard or have a valid s 59 defence?

  Rule. Section 57 defines a "professional" and "professional service"; anyone holding out a particular skill owes the care reasonably expected of a practitioner of that skill at the time (s 58). Section 59 gives an affirmative defence on breach if, at the time the service was provided, the conduct was widely accepted in Australia by a significant number of respected practitioners in the field as competent professional practice, even though there may be differing widely accepted opinions (s 59(3)); the court may nevertheless reject that opinion if it is unreasonable (s 59(2); Tanah Merah Vic Pty Ltd v Owners Corporation No 1 [2021] VSCA 72, [235]–[244]). The defendant bears the onus of proving those statutory criteria (Boxell v Peninsula Health [2019] VSC 830). Warnings and risk information fall outside s 59; liability there is governed by the Rogers v Whitaker material-risk duty (1992) 175 CLR 479, 490–493, with causation disciplined by Wallace v Kam (2013) 250 CLR 375, [34]–[40]. Courts retain the final say on breach notwithstanding expert consensus (Naxakis v Western General Hospital (1999) 197 CLR 269, [41]–[42], [57]–[58]). Expert evidence alone does not satisfy s 59 unless it proves the national, temporal, and significant-cohort requirements.

  Application. 1) Identify the professional and professional service under s 57. 2) Classify the allegation: warnings (apply Rogers/Wallace; s 60 bars s 59) versus diagnosis/treatment/practice. 3) For practice claims, apply s 58 baseline and test the s 59 elements—field, time, Australian acceptance, significant respected cohort, D’s evidentiary onus—and assess unreasonableness (Tanah Merah). 4) Remember s 59(3): multiple acceptable opinions can co-exist; the court chooses whether the relied-on opinion is reasonable.

  Conclusion. If the defendant establishes a widely accepted Australian practice that is not unreasonable, s 59 excuses breach; otherwise, breach is judged against s 58/common law standards and warnings remain within Rogers/Wallace.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems demand disciplined sequencing: define the professional field (s 57), separate warnings (s 60) from practice (s 59), and make the defendant prove each statutory element, including national scope and timing. High-band answers show the court’s supervisory role (Naxakis), deploy Tanah Merah to test reasonableness, and integrate Rogers/Wallace for warnings. Scripts that treat expert evidence or local custom as dispositive, forget the burden, or ignore s 59(3)’s allowance for competing opinions lose marks.
mnemonic: "PRO-WIDE-TIME: PROfessional? (s 57) → Warnings out (s 60) → Identify Defence (s 59) with WIDely accepted In Australia, significant practitioners, During the relevant TIME, and court review."

tripwires:
  - Applying s 59 to warnings or risk information (barred by s 60).
  - Treating expert evidence as sufficient without proving national, time-specific acceptance.
  - Assuming unanimity or local custom is required—s 59 allows multiple widely accepted opinions (s 59(3)).
  - Forgetting the defendant bears the onus of establishing the s 59 defence.
  - Ignoring the court’s supervisory role (Naxakis) and the possibility of rejecting unreasonable peer opinion.
  - Limiting the inquiry to local practice instead of testing "in Australia".
  - Skipping the s 57 step to define the professional field before applying s 59.
