  Issue — When does the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI require a duty to avoid mental harm for rescuers, secondary victims, and workplace psychiatric injury?

  Rule —
  - "Mental harm" includes pure and consequential mental harm (s 72).
  - For pure mental harm, duty arises only if a person of normal fortitude would have suffered a recognised psychiatric illness that was reasonably foreseeable, considering s 72(2) factors (relationship, control/assurance, sudden shock not required).
  - Consequential mental harm follows ordinary duty principles once physical injury is actionable.
  - See Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317, [118]–[122].

  Application scaffold —
  (1) Classify harm: pure versus consequential.
  (2) For pure harm, apply s 72(1) normal-fortitude foreseeability with s 72(2) factors.
  (3) Apply s 73(1)–(2) scene/relationship limits for shock-based secondary claims and confirm the derivative bar in s 73(3).
  (4) Rescue cases: foreseeability to rescuers without special "sudden shock" controls: Wicks v State Rail Authority of NSW (2010) 241 CLR 60, [45]–[50].
  (5) Workplace: duty turns on reasonable foreseeability of psychiatric injury in the actual role context: Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd (2005) 222 CLR 44, [36]–[40]; compare Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377, [50]–[55]. Secondary-victim duties may arise to close family in employer contexts: Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 269, [30]–[35].

  Authorities map —
  - Tame/Annetts — Foreseeability; no "shock" rule.
  - Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549, [60]–[65].
  - Gifford — Family secondary duty.
  - Wicks — Rescuers.
  - Koehler — Workplace.
  - Naidu — Workplace bullying (NSWCA).

  Statutory hook —
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt XI (Mental Harm) ss 72–75.
  - General breach/causation after duty: ss 48, 51.
  - Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) s 79 (expert opinion exception to the opinion rule).

  Tripwires —
  - Treating "normal fortitude" as a plaintiff attribute rather than a foreseeability test.
  - Re-imposing a "sudden shock" requirement not found in s 72(2).
  - Skipping s 73(1)–(2) scene/relationship limits.
  - Ignoring s 73(3) derivative-claim bar.
  - Pleading distress without a recognised psychiatric illness and expert diagnosis.

  Conclusion — Duty is most likely where statutory factors show foreseeable psychiatric illness to a person of normal fortitude, with s 73 limits met; breach/causation then follow under ss 48, 51.

why_it_matters: |
  Pt XI questions dominate exam fact patterns on rescuers, secondary victims, and occupational stress. This scaffold forces fast classification, applies the correct statutory foreseeability filter, and avoids reviving discredited sudden‑shock controls, while flagging expert‑evidence and derivative‑claim traps.

mnemonic: "CLASSIFY → FORESEE → s 73 GATE → WORKPLACE/RESCUER → EXPERT → EXIT"
