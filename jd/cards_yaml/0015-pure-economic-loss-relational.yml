front: "Pure economic loss (relational) — when will a duty arise for shutdown/third-party damage scenarios, and how should you run the salient-features test?"
back: |
  Issue. Has D assumed a duty to protect P from pure economic loss suffered relationally (e.g., business losses when a utility shuts down or third-party property is damaged)?

  Rule. Relational pure economic loss duties are exceptional. Apply the salient-features methodology (Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 192 [4]–[5], 253 [198]; Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258 at [102]–[103]) as a framework, not a closed checklist: Allsop P stressed at [103] that the features must be weighed contextually, not ticked off mechanically. Test (i) reasonable foreseeability; (ii) whether P or P’s class is determinate and known to D; (iii) D’s knowledge and control of the risk; (iv) P’s vulnerability (capacity to contract, insure or diversify); (v) any reliance/assumption of responsibility; (vi) coherence with contract/statute; and (vii) avoidance of indeterminate liability. Targeted relational loss is recoverable where D knew of an identifiable plaintiff (Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge “Willemstad” (1976) 136 CLR 529 at 556–557 (Mason J)). In commercial building contexts vulnerability is decisive: no duty where the plaintiff could bargain for protection (Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16; (2004) 216 CLR 515; Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners Corporation SP 61288 [2014] HCA 36; (2014) 254 CLR 185). Courts remain wary of broad relational claims, as shown by the refusal to extend auditors’ liability in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords (1997) 188 CLR 241. Coherence constraints per Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at 580–582 [50]–[52] prevent duties that undermine statutory schemes or other obligations. Warned supply chains (Dovuro Pty Ltd v Wilkins [2003] HCA 51; (2003) 215 CLR 317) and proportionate liability under Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA ss 24AF, 24AI interact with ACL (Cth) s 18 via ACL&FTA 2012 (Vic) s 8 and remedies in s 236.

  Application. In a Longford-type shutdown (Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Pty Ltd [2003] VSC 27; cf Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1572; 104 FCR 564) foreseeability of business interruption is obvious. (1) Identify whether P sits within a determinate, known class (e.g., named pipeline customers) or within a diffuse consumer cohort. (2) Test D’s knowledge of P’s exposure and control over the critical risk, including any warnings given (Dovuro). (3) Assess vulnerability: could P contract for continuity, maintain backups, insure or diversify, or were they locked into reliance? (4) Examine coherence: do statutory schemes (gas safety, energy regulation, ACL) or contractual allocations already cover the field, and would recognising duty conflict with them? (5) Account for statutory overlays such as Wrongs Act Pt IVAA proportionate liability if ACL s 18 is pleaded alongside negligence. Weigh each feature—avoid treating them as boxes to tick—highlighting that Caltex-style identifiable plaintiffs favour duty, whereas broad consumer classes amplify indeterminacy and coherence objections.

  Conclusion. A duty for relational economic loss is most likely where D knew (or ought to have known) of a vulnerable, determinate plaintiff/class who could not realistically self-protect, and recognition remains coherent with contractual and statutory allocations; otherwise the court will resist duty to avoid floodgates and incoherence.
why_it_matters: |
  MLS examiners expect you to move beyond “foreseeability” and execute a disciplined salient-features analysis that balances vulnerability, determinacy, control and coherence. Relational loss problems (Longford/Johnson Tiles, Caltex-class scenarios) are designed to see whether you can distinguish targeted plaintiffs from diffuse user groups, deploy Woolcock/Brookfield to show why contract and insurance matter, and integrate Wrongs Act Pt IVAA with ACL (Vic) s 18/s 236. Strong answers cite precise pinpoints, articulate why Stavar’s list structures the analysis, and explicitly weigh policy: floodgates and autonomy versus access to justice for unavoidable loss.

tripwires:
  - Treating mere foreseeability as sufficient for a PEL duty without salient features analysis.
  - Assuming all utility customers form a determinate, recoverable class.
  - Ignoring vulnerability analysis (ability to contract, insure, diversify) in commercial contexts.
  - Forgetting Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) Pt IVAA apportionment when ACL (Vic) s 18 is pleaded with negligence.
  - Pleading ACL s 18 without establishing conduct in trade or commerce and causation for s 236 damages.
  - Neglecting coherence constraints from Sullivan v Moody when statutory regimes already regulate the risk.
