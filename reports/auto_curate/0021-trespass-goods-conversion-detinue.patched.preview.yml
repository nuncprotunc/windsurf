  Issue.
  Which interference-with-goods tort applies and what remedy follows?
  Note: Overflow from front .
  “valuation dates, return orders, detention damages”.
  Rule.
  Trespass to goods protects possession against direct interference and is actionable per se (Hutchins v Maughan [1947] Victorian Law Reports (Victorian Law Reports (VLR)) 131, 132-133), so nominal damages are available.
  even without proof of loss.
  Application scaffold.
  1) Title to sue: establish actual possession or an immediate right (consider bailors/bailees.
  jus tertii rarely assists defendants).
  2) Characterise the interference: direct trespass (actionable per se), dominion supporting conversion, or demand‑refusal activating detinue.
  Authorities map.
  Trespass actionable per se and nominal damages: Hutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131, 132-133.
  Conversion .
  inconsistent dominion/refusal: Penfolds 74 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 204, 228-230.
  Bunnings [2011] New South Wales Court of Appeal (NSWCA) 342, [124].
  Statutory hook.
  Tripwires.
  Conclusion.
  Correct classification governs remedy: trespass protects possession per se.
  conversion substitutes value at conversion.
  detinue delivers return or judgment-value with detention damages because the wrong continues until compliance.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS exams reward precise sequencing: stand up your possessory title
   first, then choose between trespass (direct interference), conversion (dominion
   inconsistent with immediate right), and detinue (demand/refusal). Each tort drives
   a different remedy—especially the valuation dates and detention damages. Mislabel
   the tort and you misstate the relief, losing marks. Bunnings ensures you remember
   demand/refusal can evidence conversion, while Heavener explains why detinue’s valuation
   waits until judgment. Keep the jus tertii rule and bailment standing in view to
   secure high-band answers.

mnemonic: TCD-J → Title → Characterise → Date (conversion vs judgment) → Jus tertii
