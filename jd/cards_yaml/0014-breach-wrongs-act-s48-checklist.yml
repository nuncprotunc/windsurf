back: 'Issue.

  How should you triage Wrongs Act s 48 breach analysis under exam pressure so that
  foreseeability, precautions, and statutory overlays are covered systematically?

  __HD__0__

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48 requires: (i) a foreseeable risk known or ought to have
  been known.

  (ii) the risk must be “not insignificant”.

  (iii) a reasonable person would have taken precautions.

  (iv) s 48(2) factors (probability, seriousness, burden, social utility) must be
  weighed contextually (Wyong v Application scaffold.

  1) Frame the risk precisely at the relevant ex ante time-slice (Tapp v Australian
  Broadcasting Corporation Act (ABCRA) [2022] HCA 11 at [127]-[129], [150]-[156]).

  2) Apply s 48(1): confirm foreseeability and “not insignificant” status (exclude
  far-fetched/fanciful).

  __HD__1__

  Core framework: Wyong v Shirt.

  Wrongs Act s 48.

  Risk/time-slice discipline: Tapp [2022] HCA 11.

  Public authority/recreation: Vairy (2005) 223 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth
  Law Reports (CLR)) 422.

  Romeo (1998) 192 CLR 431.

  Cole (2004) 217 CLR 469.

  __HD__2__

  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48-56.

  Australian Consumer Law (Australian Consumer Law (ACL)) (Cth) s 60.

  Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Competition and Consumer Act (CCA)) 2010
  (Cth) s 139A.

  __HD__3__

  Treating foreseeability as breach without proving “not insignificant”.

  Reframing the risk with hindsight instead of ex ante evidence.

  Treating “obvious risk” as absolute when D heightened the danger.

  __HD__4__

  A disciplined s 48 checklist demands precise risk characterisation, contextual balancing
  of the s 48(2) factors, and explicit handling of statutory overlays.

  only then can you justify whether additional precautions were required or reasonable.

  __HD__0__

  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  __HD__1__

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  __HD__2__

why_it_matters: "MLS scripts lose marks when they cite Shirt but ignore Victorian\n\
  \  statutory rails. This checklist forces you to apply s 48(1)–(2) methodically,\
  \ integrate\n  public authority and recreational authorities, and separate breach\
  \ from causation\n  while acknowledging ACL/CCA overlays—hallmarks of an H1 answer\
  \ under pressure.\n\n  \n"
mnemonic: F-NIS → CALC → s49 → WARN/OBVIOUS → CAUSATION → ACL/CCA

tripwires:
- Treating foreseeability as sufficient without satisfying the “not insignificant”
  test.
- Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps
- Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss
