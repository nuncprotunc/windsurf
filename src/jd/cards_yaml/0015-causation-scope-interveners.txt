front: "Causation (Vic): how do ss 51â€“52 handle factual causation, exceptional cases, and scope when interveners appear?"

  Issue.
  Has D's negligence factually caused P's harm, and should liability extend to that harm under Wrongs Act ss 51â€“52 when interveners arise?

  Rule.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 51(a) requires a "necessary condition" (but-for) link.
  - Section 51(2) allows departures only in exceptional cases consistent with established principles.
  - Section 52 tasks the court with deciding whether responsibility should extend, weighing justice and policy, with the onus on P.

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Run but-for test, using circumstantial inference where needed (`Strong v Woolworths (2012) 246 CLR 182` at [5]-[9]).
  (2) Exclude bare possibility (`Amaca v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36` at [49]).
  (3) Remember loss-of-chance limits (`Tabet v Gett (2010) 240 CLR 537` at [111]-[112]).
  (4) For exceptional cases under s 51, require clear proof of established principles.
  (5) Under s 52, weigh policy factors for scope, especially with interveners.

  - `Amaca Pty Ltd v Booth (2011) 246 CLR 36` (HCA)
  - `Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem (2009) 239 CLR 420` (HCA)

  Statutory hook.
  - Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 51â€“52 (consider s 51(2) exceptional cases discipline).

  Tripwires.
  See dedicated `tripwires` field.

  Conclusion.
  Separate factual causation under s 51 from scope under s 52, signpost exceptional departures, and confront interveners with Wallace's normative lens to keep liability tightly reasoned.

why_it_matters: |
  Exams punish conflating causation limbs. Sequencing ss 51â€“52 lets you cite the right authorities, rebut 'material risk' shortcuts, and analyse interveners with Wallace's normative lensâ€”hallmarks of H1 reasoning.

tripwires:
- Treating s 51 as a material-risk shortcut.
- Confusing factual causation with scope contrary to Wallace.
- Assuming third-party actions satisfy causation without but-for proof.
- Neglecting P's onus and Evidence Act s 140 calibration.
