  Issue.
  What frame governs premises injury in Victoria: occupiers’ liability (Pt Part Part IIA (IIA)), ordinary negligence, or trespass?
  Rule.
  Part IIA abolishes entrant categories and imposes a statutory duty: take reasonable care so entrants are not injured by the state of the premises or things done/omitted in.
  relation to that state (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 14B(3)).
  otherwise common law continues (s 14B(2)).
  Application scaffold.
  1) Classify hazard: “state/things done” -> apply s 14B(3).
  2) Breach: run s 48 (foreseeable, not insignificant, reasonable precautions), with obvious/inherent risk and volenti overlays (ss 53-56).
  Authorities map.
  Duty source: Zaluzna 162 Commonwealth Law Reports (Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR)) 479, 488.
  s 14B(2)-(3).
  Contractors/activity hazards: Thompson 221 CLR 234, [23]-[27].
  Trespassers: Hackshaw 155 CLR 614, 654 (Deane J).
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 14B(2)-(3).
  s 48.
  s 51.
  ss 53-56.
  Tripwires.
  Reviving invitee/licensee categories post‑Zaluzna.
  Treating activity hazards as outside s 14B(3).
  Ignoring obvious‑risk provisions in breach.
  Assuming causation without inspection evidence (Strong).
  Denying any duty to trespassers (Hackshaw).
  Conclusion.
  __HD__0__
  State the governing test and any operative statutory provisions.

  Apply issues -> rules -> apply to facts -> conclude.

  Lead: Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7; (1987) 162 CLR 479, 488.
  __HD__3__
  Primary: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48.
  __HD__4__
  
  - Don’t exceed statutory thresholds/caps
  
  - Don’t conflate consequential with pure economic loss
  
  - Apply coherence checks before extending duties.
  __HD__5__
  Tie the analysis back to the pleadings and the available remedies/defences.

why_it_matters: |
  MLS problems mix premises hazards, activity risks and trespassers.
   High‑band answers: (i) source the duty in Pt IIA, (ii) use Pt X for breach/causation,
   (iii) avoid pre‑Zaluzna categories, (iv) use Thompson for activity hazards, (v)
   use Strong to prove causation, and (vi) pivot to trespass when force, not premises,
   causes the injury. This sequencing respects statutory integration and saves marks.

mnemonic: SITE → State (s 14B) → Integrate (ss 48/51/53–56) → Trespassers (Hackshaw)
