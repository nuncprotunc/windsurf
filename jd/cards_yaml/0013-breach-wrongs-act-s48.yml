  Breach (Vic): how do you run Wrongs Act s 48 against Shirt when testing reasonable
    precautions?
back: |
  Issue.
  Did D breach the Victorian negligence standard by failing to take reasonable precautions against a not-insignificant risk under Wrongs Act s 48?
  
  Rule.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s 48(1)–(2) codifies (but does not replace) the Shirt calculus.
  
  Application scaffold.
  1) Classify the specific risk at the correct level of generality. 2) Test foreseeability and “not insignificant” threshold using information available when action was required. 3) Apply s 48(2)(a)–(d): probability (time-slice per Tapp), seriousness of harm, burden/cost of precautions, social utility or competing responsibilities.
  
  Authorities map.
  Framework: Wyong v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40; Wrongs Act s 48.
  
  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 48–56; ACL (Cth) s 60; CCA 2010 (Cth) s 139A.
  
  Tripwires.
  Treating foreseeability alone as breach without proving “not insignificant” risk. Mischaracterising the risk (too broad/narrow). Arguing breach via hindsight contrary to s 49. Treating “obvious risk” as absolute where D created/exacerbated danger.
  
  Conclusion.
  Breach is established only if, on the information reasonably available, a prudent actor would have taken cost-justified precautions under the s 48 calculus; hindsight, obvious risk rhetoric or resource pressures do not excuse avoidable
  
why_it_matters: |
  Exams target candidates who recite Shirt without engaging the Victorian
    statute. Leading with s 48(1) forces precise risk definition and the “not insignificant”
    filter. Weighing s 48(2) factors against contextual authorities (public land, recreation,
    crowd control) shows disciplined statutory reasoning, keeps breach distinct from
    duty and causation, and demonstrates you can integrate ACL/CCA overlays.
