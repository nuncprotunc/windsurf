front: "In a Victorian personal injury exam, how do you navigate Pt VBA damages thresholds, caps, and aggravated/exemplary characterisation?"

  Issue.
  Determine whether Pt VBA unlocks non-economic, aggravated, and exemplary damages for a Victorian plaintiff, and set out how each head must be characterised once access is secured.

  Rule.
  Pt VBA (Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 28LBâ€“28LK) demands a court-endorsed significant injury certificate unless s 28LC(2)(a) or s 28LJ triggers an exception.
  s 28LF sets impairment thresholds and medical panel review mechanics.
  Certified plaintiffs remain bound by the indexed non-economic caps in ss 28Gâ€“28H and the earnings ceiling in s 28F(2).
  Aggravated damages stay compensatory (Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd (1966) 117 CLR 118 at 149 (HCA)).
  Exemplary relief punishes only where compensation is inadequate and must be proportionate (Gray v Motor Accident Commission (1998) 196 CLR 1 at 18â€“19 (HCA); Lamb v Cotogno (1987) 164 CLR 1 at 12 (HCA)).
  State defendants remain exposed (State of NSW v Ibbett (2006) 229 CLR 638 at 648 (HCA)).

  Application scaffold.
  (1) Identify pleaded heads of damage and confirm Pt VBA applies.
  (2) Obtain the significant injury certificate or prove the s 28LC(2)(a) or s 28LJ exception, documenting any medical panel process.
  (3) Calculate impairment under s 28LF with current AMA or psychiatric metrics and diarise the review deadline.
  (4) Apply indexed caps in ss 28Gâ€“28H and the s 28F(2) ceiling, stating the indexation year relied on.
  (5) Distinguish aggravated compensation from exemplary punishment within Gray limits and reconcile overlaps with statutory penalties or parallel claims.

  Authorities map.
  - Gray v Motor Accident Commission (1998) 196 CLR 1 at 18â€“19 â€” confines exemplary awards to proportionate punishment.
  - Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd (1966) 117 CLR 118 at 149 â€” aggravated damages repair dignitary loss.
  - Lamb v Cotogno (1987) 164 CLR 1 at 12 â€” exemplary damages demand a punitive rationale.
  - State of NSW v Ibbett (2006) 229 CLR 638 at 648 â€” exemplary relief remains available against the State.

  Statutory hook.
  Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ss 28LBâ€“28LK, 28LC(2)(a), 28LF, 28F(2), 28Gâ€“28H â€” certificate process, exceptions, thresholds, and caps.

  Tripwires.
  - Skipping the certificate gateway before pricing damages.
  - Collapsing aggravated with exemplary analysis.
  - Ignoring indexed caps in ss 28Gâ€“28H or the s 28F(2) ceiling.
  - Citing relief without Gray, Uren, or an equivalent lead authority.

  Conclusion.
  Deliver a statute-led roadmap: prove or excuse the certificate, apply the indexed caps, and separate aggravated from exemplary relief with the leading authorities.
  That sequencing shows command of Pt VBA mechanics and earns remedial credibility under exam pressure.

why_it_matters: |
  Damages questions reward the student who clears Pt VBA before chasing quantum. You must show whether a significant injury certificate or statutory exception opens the gate, then demonstrate command of indexed caps and the earnings ceiling rather than reciting stale figures. Distinguishing aggravated from exemplary relief with Gray, Uren, and Ibbett avoids double counting and signals awareness of punishment restraints. This scaffold keeps you disciplined under time pressure and satisfies markers looking for statute-led reasoning.
